            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>By one of them which was called <hi>Antigonus, Demetrius</hi> was begotten, a Prince no leſs famous for the greatneſs of his Minde, then the handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Body.</p>
               <p>To him alone it appeared, That Heaven with a hand rather Prodigal then Liberal, would give what it had of moſt value in the Rich Treaſury of Nature. <hi>Demetrius</hi> was obſerved by all as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy

               <p>This Prince then and <hi>Fila</hi> his wife were <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi>'s Parents.</p>
               <p>She was preſented to the World in that time, when the Stars were moſt active to Characterize a Womans Nativity with the gentleneſs of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hilde grew apace, and her Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Beauty diſplaying it ſelf (which, reſtrained in the narrow confines of that ſo tender Age, was not fit yet to raiſe up with a Grace the appetite of Senſe) arrived at that height, That poſſeſſing the Mindes of all her beholders with a ſudden admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave occaſion to men of doubting, whether ſhe was Mortal or no.</p>
               <p>I would willingly draw here to the life the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture of this Queen, if my black Ink were not too unfit a colour to ſet forth a Celeſtial Beauty.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader therefore imagine a Face, and a Body ſhaped with the moſt exquiſite proportion, of a hew as white as the driven Snow, and cloathed with the beſt Grace. Let him conceive in his fancy ſuch a Readineſs in her, as is moſt commended in Speaking; ſuch a Modeſty, as is moſt approved in Converſation; and ſuch Courteſie, as is moſt deſired in Courtſhip; and of all theſe particulars, let him finally beleeve <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Compoſition. Nature left her nothing to deſire, but bright ſhining Hair;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180450:4"/>for hers was neither yellow, nor black, but of a middle colour; but the brownneſs of her Cheſtnut coloured Hair, together with the whiteneſs of her Face and black Eyes, without doubt repreſented her more beautiful.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Fame grown greater then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, though not the Truth, flew with moſt glorious applauſe through the remoteſt Provinces of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its flight was ſo fortunate, that where by it ſelf it could not arrive, it came driven by the ſound of her Fathers Martial Trumpets; ſo as where they recounted <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Victories, they likewiſe made mention of <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Beauty.</p>
               <p>The Priſoners which were brought from the Camp to the Court where ſhe was, having frequent occaſions of ſeeing her, took it for a very great happineſs that they had been overcome; for they knew it was not lawful for any to ſee ſo much Beauty, without the loſs of his Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apelles</hi> lived in that time. His age, though then great, yet was not at that paſs to diminiſh one jot the force of his Body, or the vigor of his Minde. He no leſs famous for his Penſil in the Excellency of his Art, then bold of Spirit in the variety of his Deſigns, made it appear to the World for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Maxime, That the greateſt Wits are more violent and hardy in their Affections then others. He hearing <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Beauty much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, deſired extreamly to draw her Picture. He ſuppoſed that the Glories of his Penſil could no where receive greater honor, then from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180450:5"/>Fame. Being then reſolved for ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, he ſtole away from <hi>Corinth,</hi> the place of his abode, and in few days arrived at <hi>Burſia,</hi> a City ſeated at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Olympus,</hi> where <hi>Demetrius</hi> had his reſidence.</p>
               <p>The Cuſtom of the Queens in never ſhewing themſelves publiquely, unleſs on Solemn days, for ſome Moneths would have retarded the execution of <hi>Apelles</hi> his deſign, if his Fortune had not brought him to that place in a time, that was near a noble Sacrifice, which they every year uſed to celebrate for three days together in the Temple of the Idol <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All beginnings do concur in order to the end, when the end crowns the Work.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the rareſt Fabricks of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that Temple was eſteemed as the greateſt. It had four Frontiſpieces of the fineſt poliſhed Marble, and as many great Gates. In the middle of the Temple was erected a proud Altar, very eaſie to be ſeen from all the four doors.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the days (which were deſtined to the Sacrifice) being come, and the greater part of the Nobility and People gathered together with ſolemn pomp within the Court, <hi>Apelles</hi> (who had with anticipated time made choice of a very fit place behinde a Pillar) as ſoon as he ſaw among the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving multitude the longed for <hi>Stratonica,</hi> with her Mother the Queen, to enter into the Temple, I know not by what cauſe (being overcome with wonder) remained not ſenſeleſs. That pillar per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure (which he uſed as a wall to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180450:5"/>him) bequeathed to him its qualities; if we may not rather ſay, That he needed much a pillar to keep him on his legs, at the firſt encounter of that faireſt ſight.</p>
               <p>She, with her Mother, being ſeated near the Altar on a Throne, which they uſed to prepare for their Majeſties on ſuch days, ſeemed a Goddeſs worthy to be bowed to by the Idol it ſelf, whom all bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not preſent with theſe Queens, for he was engaged in the war he had made againſt <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy.</hi> His abſence eclipſed the rayes of <hi>Apelles</hi> his glory. He, after he had for a good while (while the Prieſts were expected at the Ceremonies) fed the firſt hunger of his eyes, with the ſight of an object ſo rare, began (as if come to himſelf) to think of his Penſil, and Deſigning. To that end ſnatching ſuddenly a Black-lead Pen with ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he deſigned in haſte the lineaments onely of her face, to be able better afterwards in his lodging, to colour with his Penſils her Image ſo lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his minde.</p>
               <p>The good old man (while he formed his deſign in that maner behinde the pillar) reſembled ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prometheus,</hi> ſtealing the beams from the Sphaer of the Sun.</p>
               <p>That would certainly have happened to him, which befel him in the painting of <hi>Campaſpe,</hi> if the froſt of his ſnowy age had not kept his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt from the flames, which were breathed by that countenance.</p>
               <p>So in thoſe three days of the Sacrifice, he having
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180450:6"/>the opportunity of beholding <hi>Stratonica</hi> at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo happily finiſhed her Picture, that in nothing but ſilence it differed from the original.</p>
               <p>The joy he had that the Picture was well done, exceeded far <hi>Pigmalions</hi> for the beauty of his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>Being therefore ready to go homewards, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proud <hi>Jaſon,</hi> returning from the conqueſt of the golden Fleece. He found no opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to adorn with that Picture his Cabinet, where he kept the deareſt pieces he had, but forced to deviate from the ſhorteſt way (by reaſon of the wars of the adjacent Countries) he arrived at <hi>Nicomedia:</hi> Finding there a Galley that was bound for <hi>Corinth,</hi> he embarqued himſelf very gladly, and began his journey.</p>
               <p>The Sea ſhewing its beauty in a calm, and the Wind in that ſerenity its faith, enticed all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to be enamored of their voyage; but their conſtancy laſted but a day.</p>
               <p>The Sun did ſet that Evening, covered over with clouds; and the Heavens, by the colour of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral habit, ſeemed to repreſent to the Saylors the horror of an approaching death.</p>
               <p>The firſt hours of the night, aſſembled together all the breath of the Wind, which blew from the land; and they went not much farther, but by little and little they heard the North-wind blow freſh a far off.</p>
               <p>As the waves grew bigger and bigger, ſo the clouds in like maner were condenſed, as if that the Stars had procured them to hide all their faces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180450:6"/>they wanted courage to look on the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the ſea was about to commit.</p>
               <p>Now the wind, grown impetuous, roar'd aloud among the Maſts and the Sayl-yards, which beaten by the Ropes, ſeemed in a maner to inform them by a doleful whiſtling, That the Sayls being too big with wind, were ſtraight to be delivered by the death of the Galley.</p>
               <p>It rained without end, and lightned moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. 'Twas fearful to ſee by the light of the Lamps, the huge height of the waves, which (reſembling ſnowy mountains, by the foam which grew white on their backs) came rowling all along to bury the unfortunate Veſſel.</p>
               <p>The Marriners therefore turning all pale, fell ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily to eaſing of their Galley, by throwing into the Sea all the Fardels and Cheſts which came next to their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apelles</hi> in ſo great a confuſion, having nothing but a Hamper, in which were lockt ſome cloaths, together with <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Picture, was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceal it for ſome time; but ſeeing that they continued caſting overboard, knew not how longer to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>What wilt thou do unhappy <hi>Apelles,</hi> now that thy life and thy glory depend (to ſpeak ſo) on the will of a mad Sea? If with drowning thy ſelf, thou wert ſure to keep thy Picture, I beleeve thou wouldſt gladly loſe thy life to ſave that, which would make thy life eternal; but the evil of it is, that thy loſs both in this and in that is the ſame.</p>
               <p>O Gods, if any one could have ſeen what varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180450:7"/>of things in a moment, that Wit then thought of, who ſhewed himſelf always co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tagious in his actions!</p>
               <p>When he had been for a while ſo ambiguous, he ſuddenly ſnatcht the Hamper, and ſeeing that the Rain was gone by break of day, which though dusky, yet came on apace, he took out <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Picture, and expoſing it in haſte to the eyes of the Marriners, cryed out,</p>
               <p>Behold, O Friends, behold her Picture, who now can onely ſave us! Behold, O Sacred Goddeſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our Dangers, hear our Lamentations, ſuffer not the Waves to drown the devoted to that Deity which is born of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Every one being ſtupid and dazled at the Beauty of that Face (which they certainly beleeved was the Picture of <hi>Venus</hi>) made ſo doleful a noiſe, and wept in that maner, as it would have moved to pity any other thing but the Sea.</p>
               <p>While they ſo prayed, were it by chance, or diabolical operation, the Galley arrived in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Creek, where the Sea with a great deal leſs noiſe did beat the ſandy pavement of the ſhore.</p>
               <p>The wretched ſhipwrack'd-men had now ſome time to breathe, but they breathed in that maner, as if they had been doubtful of their ſafety, ſo ſudden a change of Fortune had aſtoniſhed them ſo much: But aſſured that they were ſafe, they went aſhore, and although they were far off from all Humane commerce and habitation, yet in touching that barren Coaſt, they had all the pleaſures which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180450:7"/>the greateſt and moſt flouriſhing City could afford them.</p>
               <p>They ſtayed there two days, till the Sea was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, to recover themſelves of the diſaſters they had ſuffered. Thence putting again to Sea, they landed in a little time after at the much deſired Haven of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certain Ambaſſadors of <hi>Seleucus</hi> (driven by the ſame tempeſt) arrived alſo there, who returned for ſome Affairs from <hi>Caſſander</hi> then reigning in <hi>Caria.</hi> They deſirous to ſee a City renowned for many things, after they had viſited the principal places, came to <hi>Apelles</hi> his houſe.</p>
               <p>There he (in the middle of a very great Hall) ſtood with his miraculous Penſil, diſtinguiſhing from the <hi>Chaos</hi> of colours, ſo many Worlds as he had Pictures at hand.</p>
               <p>The Figures then finiſhed, ſeemed as if they gloried in their Being; and on the contrary ſide, to deſire their perfection, who had not then obtained it. The Skin and the Fleſh grew viſibly on thoſe Muſcles, which had nothing that was faigned but Opinion. The Figures would have ſpoken, if <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> like another <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> had not firſt of all taught them to be ſilent in his School.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors were amazed, and ſeemed no leſs Figures, then the Figures themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt in his Cabinet, where his perfecteſt things were, they preſently fixt their eyes on <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Picture. They would have kneeled to it, for the majeſty of that Countenance would not let them beleeve it was a Picture. They could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180450:8"/>how thoſe Eyes and that Mouth had not life; and they ſtood with ſo much reverence contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that they bluſhed.</p>
               <p>They thought that <hi>Stratonica</hi> ſaid, I boaſt of two Forms, the one from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the other from <hi>Apelles:</hi> If I had not had the firſt, it had been no matter, provided that I had not wanted the ſecond. To be born in <hi>Apelles</hi> his time, and painted by him, is to have (as it were) the priviledge of being twice born. That Being which <hi>Apelles</hi> hath given me, envies that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe it hath no life; that envies this, becauſe it is not ſubject to death.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors (taken up with ſuch like thoughts) ſaid, 'Twas happier to be a Picture, and have always the ſight of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> then a man, and not preſent in that place.</p>
               <p>Man hath no happier Deceit to feign himſelf a Deity, then the Art of Painting.</p>
               <p>It is a glorious thing to know how to make a Body, it would be more glorious to know how to form a Soul; but if the Soul were a viſible Object (ſo much imitation hath intrenched on ſacred things) the Painter would give life to his Pictures.</p>
               <p>But the Ambaſſadors returned to <hi>Seleucus</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt memorable things they had ſeen in their journey) related to him the ſtory of that Picture.</p>
               <p>The King beleeving what they ſaid in the praiſe of <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Beauty, and enticed with the Fame of <hi>Apelles</hi> his Art, was preſently on fire for the ſame. A Gentleman to that end was diſpatcht to the Painter, with order to pay him for that piece
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180450:8"/>any ſum he ſhould demand; provided he would part with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apelles</hi> (as ſoon as he had heard what <hi>Seleucus</hi> deſired) much lamented his ill fortune, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavored to deprive him of ſo precious a Jewel. In the end, having very well conſidered what was beſt to be done, he refuſed the Money and delivered the Picture.</p>
               <p>It is needful to ſell dearly to Princes, or to give freely to them; the firſt is more ſecure, the latter would be Nobler, if many great perſons hated not the actions in private men, which (having more of greatneſs then the ſtate of a private life requires) reſemble the actions of a Princely Minde.</p>
               <p>The Picture being come to <hi>Seleucus</hi> his hands, it is impoſſible to deſcribe his aſtoniſhment at it. Thoſe Eyes and that Face (which were nothing but ſhadows joyned together) darted ſuch a light on the old mans Minde, that they dazled his Reaſon, and inflamed his Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> grown a Lover, what childiſh things fell not he into? what indignities did he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? Made an Idolater of a Goddeſs more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Opinion then Eſſence; while he adored the Copy, he ſighed for the Original. He ſpake to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and had no Body with him at that time, when his buſineſs gave him leave to be alone, he beheld it, reverenced it, kiſſed it, being onely ſo happy in his unhappineſs, as he could, when he pleaſed, ſatisfie himſelf with thoſe ſhadows of Beauty, which in being onely ſhadows, were extreamly like Beauty.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:180450:9"/>
               <p>Having thus, with the memory of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> oftentimes an occaſion of remembring <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and thinking very ſeriouſly on the credit and glory he had purchaſed in the Wars, he reſolved for the love of his Daughter, or as <hi>Plutarch</hi> rather ſayes, (to ſtrengthen himſelf with a potent Kings friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) To requeſt her in Marriage.</p>
               <p>Ambaſſadors being therefore diſpatcht to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> he expected the iſſue of the Embaſſie with great uncertainty of Minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> was a very wiſe Prince, though laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious: And though he was then in that condition, that it ſeemed eaſie to him to aſpire to the Empire of all <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet, conſidering that nothing was leſs certain then Martial Expeditions, he neglected not the means to fortifie himſelf with that aſſiſtance, which he judged to be beſt againſt the aſſaults of all ſudden Accidents whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Having therefore underſtood the Kings minde, he not onely was well pleaſed with the offer of his Alliance, but likewiſe reſolved to conduct the Bride himſelf into his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors returning to <hi>Seleucus</hi> with ſo fortunate an Anſwer, ſo tranſported him with joy, that he was almoſt diſtracted.</p>
               <p>He no ſooner had heard that news, but he was all a fire to celebrate the Nuptials.</p>
               <p>He therefore gave order to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Son, to prepare himſelf ſpeedily (with the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of the Court) to be gone towards <hi>Burſia,</hi> and from thence to accompany <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the deſired <hi>Stratonica.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:180450:9"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> (who was a youth of great hopes, and of an age ripe for marriage) without doubt ſeemed fitter for that match then <hi>Seleucus;</hi> but he that with the colour of his hair had not changed yet the vigor of his minde (being ſtill in an age that could command in Loves aſſaults, and preferring his own pleaſure before his Sons) would have her for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>All things being ready, <hi>Antiochus</hi> departed with a very good attendance of the nobleſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and carrying with him very fair Preſents, in leſs then eight days arrived in <hi>Burſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> (who then was come back from the Expedition againſt <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) there received him with great Demonſtrations of kindneſs, and preſented him to <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who was lodged in the end of the Pallace.</p>
               <p>His Reception was glorious, and the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which paſſed between them, confirmed their affection and mutual Devotion.</p>
               <p>The eyes of the Prince (which were eager in gazing on <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s face) ſhould in reaſon have cauſed a ſudden fainting in his heart, yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alteration was not great; were it that <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> being yong, and not knowing the true value of Beauty, was not ripe yet for Love; or were it (as 'tis more credible) that Love being to win him by little and little, could not with thoſe firſt flaſhes kindle a fire which could be perceived.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Court was full of joy for ſo great a Perſons coming, and many Shows and Feaſts were ordained in the City to entertain him the more honorably.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:180450:10"/>
               <p>While they were thus employed in <hi>Burſia, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> (who had no other life, but what the hope gave him of ſoon being in his Miſtriſſes arms) ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with frequent and indefatigable Poſts, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> his return.</p>
               <p>The hours of the day (too too fleet and ſoon gone) ſeemed Ages to him. He was offended with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his Scepter wanted Power to invert the Motions of the Celeſtial Machines, to make that Day inſtantly come, which was to illuminate his Nuptials.</p>
               <p>They are extream in their affections, who are in the extremity of fortune. A Prince (that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a God) is angry to do things like a man. He thinks it a defect, if his Power be not as ready in performing, as his Will is in deſiring; whence run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of his deſires the ſhorteſt way, he invades and overthrows oftentimes all the humane and ſacred reſpects which do thwart him.</p>
               <p>In the end after three Moneths, which were ſpent by <hi>Demetrius</hi> in preparing all things needful for the Voyage, and expecting a time fit to ſayl in, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with <hi>Fila</hi> his wife, <hi>Stratonica</hi> and <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and arriving at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where a gallant Navy was in order for that purpoſe, he embarqued himſelf for the coaſt of <hi>Soria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas then the Moneth of <hi>June,</hi> from whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Majeſty the fearful Winds flying, durſt build no more clouds in the Heavens, nor erect any Waves in the Sea. The Fleet ſayled on a Plain of moving Chriſtal, having onely ſo much wind in their Sails, as ſerved to make peaceably their way.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:180450:10"/>
               <p>'Twas a very fine ſight to ſee the huge Galley (which carried the three Princes) flame all of Gold, and draw after it for bravery its Streamers of Purple along the contiguous ſhore.</p>
               <p>The proud Ornaments that deckt it, were a Patern perhaps to <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> Ship, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeen to ride in ſuch Pomp upon <hi>Nilus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was ſo capacious, that it held two thouſand of the Guard, and beſides many very uſeful Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, had a Piazza and Gardens proudly compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Prore and the Poupe.</p>
               <p>The Pride of the Kings of <hi>Aſia</hi> was not onely not content to tame the Sea with the weight of ſuch prodigious Fabricks, but would alſo (inverting the Order of Nature) have Trees ſeen to bloſſom, and fruit ripen too in thoſe Barren and Salt Plains.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other Maids of Honor which <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> had brought with her, was by chance <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisba,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Fauſtus, Demetrius</hi> his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. She had (to accompany the Nobleneſs of her Blood) a moſt beautiful Body, and as fair a Minde.</p>
               <p>She was skilful in Rhetorique, and very well learned; She had good skill in Muſick, and made as good Verſes as any of the Poets of her time. She was infinitely well Faſhioned, but humorous; and all her Actions ſhewed a kinde of Greatneſs and Spirit, which made her much admired.</p>
               <p>She was for thoſe qualities, not onely well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and eſteemed by <hi>Stratonica,</hi> but likewiſe of all the Court. <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Gemus reſembling <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s both in Muſick and Poetry, he took
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180450:11"/>delight to be every day in her Company, to Sing and make Verſes.</p>
               <p>This Recreation encreaſing with Pleaſure, was a little while after the cauſe of great Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but the friendſhip ſo augmented in <hi>Sophonisba</hi> (who was very full of life) that it quickly turned to love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> at that time was but ſeventeen years of age. He was tall of ſtature, and very finely ſhaped, though ſtill growing. His Maſculine gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (encreaſing with his age) began then to bud in the full blown Beauty of his Face. He looked and ſpake ſo ſweetly, that all ſwore the Graces had their reſidence in his Eyes and in his Mouth. His Minde was as Reſolute as Gallant; and though he was young, yet he always ſhewed great Conſtancy in his Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>The now Love-ſick <hi>Sophonisba</hi> felt therefore her Bowels to burn with more violence, by how much ſhe endeavored to conceal with greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy her flame.</p>
               <p>Thoſe amorous fits would have ſhortly come to dotage, if ſhe had not very wiſely uſed means to help decaying Nature.</p>
               <p>To be often in the ſight of her beloved, was the way to feed in her a great part of that deſire, which was nouriſhed by nothing but <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Preſence. But the Waters of thoſe Viſits ſerved for no other end to her Amorous Dropſie, but to make her thirſt the greater. All the eaſe ſhe had (if it be credible that a ſecret Lover can have any eaſe) conſiſted not in any thing, but in mentioning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180450:11"/>him often, and praiſing him to <hi>Stratonica</hi> her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>She diſguized her Praiſes of affection in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Duty, adventuring to hide with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that which no pretext could do her the favor to reveal.</p>
               <p>But the Sentinels now began to diſcover <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> his Navy from the Mountains of <hi>Soria. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> (who two days before was come with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Army to <hi>Tripolis</hi> to meet with his Bride) as ſoon as he knew it, gave orders to his Soldiers to be ready, and he with the Flower of his Court very gloriouſly Adorned, went aboard certain <hi>Bucen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori</hi> of the nature of Galleys, to go meet with his heart which was coming to him in his Miſtreſſes Boſom.</p>
               <p>The firſt Salutations in the approaching of the Fleet, were artificial Sounds, paſſing through the holes of a thouſand hollow inſtruments of Box.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they joyned to <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Sighs, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an equal Wind, either to refrigerate his Flames, or to blow them with more Violence.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had Boarded one another, 'twas a Sight (that deſerved to be ſeen by all the World) to ſee with what Majeſty and Ceremony the two Kings received one another, at whoſe onely Names the remoteſt Confines of <hi>Aſia</hi> trembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> beheld <hi>Demetrius</hi> and admired him. The Beauty of his Body and the Gallantry of his Minde repreſented him to <hi>Seleucus</hi> for more then a Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> on the other ſide reverenced <hi>Seleucus</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:180450:12"/>as a Relick of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Glories, and as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain who had been a Soldier under the Command of a Man, to whom the Command of one World ſeemed too little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> was tall of Stature and ſtrong of Body, in ſo much that on a time when <hi>Alexander</hi> was a ſacrificing, by chance a wilde Bull having fled from the Altar, was by him caught again, and held faſt.</p>
               <p>He was clad that day in a sky-coloured Armor ſparkling with pieces of poliſhed Silver. He had on the ſide of his Heart (ſet in his Corſlet) a heart of fine Corral, near which a Sun of Gold was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented darting its Beams on it.</p>
               <p>The extravagant wearing of his Crown, which (reſting on a Rowl of fine Biſſe, woven with divers colours) gilded his temples, and the wanton neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his regal Mantle falling from his right ſhoulder, and hanging on the ſide he wore his Sword, were an alluring Habit, which though they were fitter for a man of fifty years, misbecame him not at all.</p>
               <p>Having ended their Complements, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing much together for their new made Alliance, <hi>Antiochus</hi> (who had at the firſt done his Duty to his Father) bowed to him again, and <hi>Seleucus</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quitted <hi>Demetrius</hi>) embraced him with great kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Thence going all three towards the Chambers of the Queens, they were very well ſeen by the Gentlemen and Soldiers there preſent of both Crowns.</p>
               <p>The Sea groaned quietly under the ſtroaks of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180450:12"/>Oars of ſo many Galleys, and the Air being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with Millions of Sounds of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, made ſo great a noiſe, that it wearied the Eccho's of the neighboring Shores.</p>
               <p>The three Princes (being come to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber of the Poupe) heard themſelves wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed on the ſudden by a Conſort of Viols, whoſe ſtrings without doubt would have played away <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> his Heart, if the hand that toucht them had plaid more then once.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner they had begun, but the door was opened to them.</p>
               <p>I want a Similitude to expreſs with it the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that by drawing of that Curtain was preſented to the eyes of <hi>Seleucus.</hi> The removing of a Vail, which ſhews in the night the Glory of a Scene beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with innumerable Lights, is a vile Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> reſembled a man, who departing this life opens his eyes in another world.</p>
               <p>The Chamber was all covered with Mother of Pearl: The Conjunctions of Gold which held them together, were wrought with fine Figures. <hi>Stratonica</hi> with <hi>Fila</hi> her Mother ſate on a Couch of cloth of Silver on Cuſhions of the ſame. Eight or ten Children cloathed like little Cupids with a Bow and a Quiver at their flanks, plaid up and down. More below in a circle ſate twelve beautiful Maids of Honor, among which <hi>Sophonisba</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs eminent in Beauty then in Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> was habited like a Nymph; the Gold and Jewels ſhe wore, exceeded much the value of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180450:13"/>Kingdom. But <hi>Fila</hi> ſeated with a Crown on her head, was Majeſtick and Grave.</p>
               <p>Thoſe amorous Archers had a cuſtom (when any went in to the Queens) to ſhoot at them (for Ornament) with their Bows. Were it by Chance, or by Art, one of the Arrows (gilded and blunt) as <hi>Seleucus</hi> entered in, hit him on the heart, which we ſpake of before.</p>
               <p>He was ſo tranſported in that his firſt appearance, that by his diſorder his good grace was in danger of miſcarrying. All his life was reduced into a look, and the Queens onely knew he was a live by his looks.</p>
               <p>The admiration in ſeeing one another was reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal in all.</p>
               <p>The Queens had heard often of <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Fame, and deſired as much to ſee him, as he to ſee them.</p>
               <p>The good King kneeled as they roſe up, and with a ſtammering tongue deſired to kiſs their hands. They forcing him to riſe, would by no means permit him to do them that ſervice. At laſt being gently reproved by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he roſe up and ſaid to them,</p>
               <p>I ſhould rejoyce with you (my Ladies) if in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquired a Son in Law and a Husband ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to your merits, you could ſay you had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Purchaſe. My Crown (though eſteemed by the world) deſerves not to be valued by you, but for this, that 'tis rich in incomparable Devotion and Affection to your Majeſties. It belongs then to you (O my Queens) to rejoyce with me. I onely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180450:13"/>(among all that are this day alive in the World) have more obligation to the Stars, then any man beſides. To live when <hi>Stratonica</hi> lives, to be the Companion of her Fortune, and the end of her Thoughts, are ſuch Graces, as Heaven never gives, but when it intends perfect Happineſs. To make me very fortunate, be pleaſed, O <hi>Stratonica,</hi> my Miſtreſs, to accept of me readily for your Servant, and give me ſome aſſurance of it, that my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being known to the World, every one may ſwear, I no longer am Mortal.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid ſo, he embraced her with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and kiſſed her.</p>
               <p>Thou diedſt not <hi>Seleucus</hi> of pleaſure, becauſe it was impoſſible for thee to die in the mouth of thy life. Thy Soul in that kiſs had contracted all the pleaſures which Love hath to give. If thou hadſt not loved <hi>Stratonica</hi> in that maner, that thy paſſionate Affection made thee chaſte, that ſweet Povſon would not doubtleſs have found an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Queens were well ſatisfied with <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Behavior and Expreſſions, and anſwered him with that courteſie, which is due in like caſes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time all the Courtiers there preſent, hung at the mouth of the Princes, obſerving their Majeſties, and admiring their carriage.</p>
               <p>Having ended their Ceremonies, they diſcourſed of other matters; in the progreſs of which, <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſtealing often his Soul from his words, gave it to his looks.</p>
               <p>His eyes were ſo eager in beholding <hi>Stratonica,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:180450:14"/>that they were like the eyes of the Bird that hatches her Eggs with her looks.</p>
               <p>O what immenſity of Beauty, reſtrained in the narrow confines of a Face, preſents it ſelf, <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to thy view? Why ſeeſt thou it, and dieſt not, ſince Seeing and Dying deprive alike of life an enamored Heart? It perhaps preſerves thy life to think, that thoſe animated Alabaſters live not, and ſoften not for any but thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>The poſſeſſion of a Happineſs ſo great, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly able to give life; but if the poſſeſſion of Beauty be not otherwiſe enjoyed, then by looking upon it, That poſſeſſion is unprofitable which hath no longer pleaſure then the laſting of a look.</p>
               <p>By that time the Navy (ſlowly ſailing on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Haven) arrived.</p>
               <p>They diſ-imbarked with that greatneſs and pomp, which became well the Majeſty of a King, and a Lovers firſt deſire.</p>
               <p>But among the ſtatelieſt things which were ſeen in <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Delights, was a very great Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, made all of Wood in that maner, that Two thouſand men hired for that purpoſe, could inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet it together. It was rarely well built, all gilded, and curiouſly Painted: When it was taken aſunder, they carried it conveniently on Carts in the journey.</p>
               <p>In this Pallace, every night (while they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from <hi>Tripolis</hi> to <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) the Princes were ſo gallantly lodged, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Apolline, and the Delights of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> (which followed after) in compariſon of them, might be juſtly called Shadows.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:180450:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> rode in a Chariot drawn by four Birds of that bigneſs, that it is liker a fable then the truth to relate it.</p>
               <p>They breed in the Inhoſpitable Mountains of <hi>Giava</hi> the greater; and it is written of them, that they carried with ſuch eaſe through the Air a Calf, faſtned to their Talons, as a Falcon would a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>By the Winged Courſers, we may judge of the reſt of the Chariot.</p>
               <p>The Armies of both Crowns went before, and Fifty other Chariots followed after; in which were the Princes, the Ladies, and chief Officers of the Court.</p>
               <p>It was Majeſtick to ſee with what Military Rule and good Order they travelled. The Pioneers joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two Legions, levelled the Hills, removed the Woods, and dryed up the Rivers, if need ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>The power of Kings can do theſe wonders, and it is not a wonder that it can do ſo much. If man be the King of Animals, to be King of many Men, is to be King of many Kings; and who wonders, that the Actions of a King ſhould be great, ſince in them the Aſſiſtance of ſo many Kings concurs.</p>
               <p>All Ages envyed the Plains which <hi>Stratonica</hi> paſſed over, being the Scene of ſo beautiful a ſight.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader imagine, That the Soul of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> was diſtributed among all his Soldiers. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them co-operated with that diligence to his end, that the new Lover had nothing elſe to do but to deſire. The ſlowneſs of their march one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180450:15"/>vexed him: He deſired that <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Chariot would have flown, and perhaps to that end he put the Birds in it; but who knows that thoſe Birds were not <hi>Seleucus</hi> his winged Deſires? They doubtleſs would have flown in my Opinion, if the Bridle of Reſpect, due to his Queen, had not checkt them.</p>
               <p>But being near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> they were met, and received by the City, with the greateſt ſigns of Loyalty, that faithful Subjects could demonſtrate to their Prince.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Triumphals and Altars were erected, the ſtreets hung with Tapiſtry, and the Playes and Balls which that day were ſeen, would weary any Tongue, and any Pen.</p>
               <p>The concourſe of people was ſo great, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Inhabitants of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> torrents of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons came tumbling from the neighboring Cities. The Galleries, the Balcones and Windows were all filled; and the reſt of the people, not knowing which way elſe to come to ſee, hung on the ridges of the houſes, and kept themſelves from falling, by leaning on the Walls.</p>
               <p>The huge throng of people would have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtifled thouſands of the Curious, if a Maſque recreating their ſpirits, had not kept them alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> uſed always to go masked; were it that the World was unworthy to ſee her Face, or were it, that ſhe feared leſt her Face might occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ruine to the World. Howſoever it was, a little piece of Velvet, or Black-Taffaty, hid from the eyes of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> that Beauty, which neither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180450:15"/>high Mountains, nor vaſt Seas could conceal from the eyes of <hi>Seleucus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being arrived at the Pallace (which ſtood at the head of a very large Piazza) and weary of their journey, they repoſed four days, and the Sacrifices in the mean time, and nuptial Magnificence, were prepared.</p>
               <p>In the end, the day being come that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Seleucus</hi> (after he had ſolemnly Sacrificed) eſpouſed his dear <hi>Stratonica</hi> by the hands of the high Prieſt. Having afterwards cauſed her to ſit down on the right hand of his Throne, he made all his Lords ſwear Loyalty to her, and acknowledge her for their Queen.</p>
               <p>The Feaſts that then followed, and the Banquets which were made, are far beyond all imagination.</p>
               <p>No Pleaſure was omitted, nor Show laid aſide: But that which had power above every thing elſe, to tranſport the hearts of all with a wonder, was a very vaſt Theater, which the Engineer of the port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pallace, that we ſpake of before, had built on that ſpacious Piazza.</p>
               <p>It was (like a Geryon) compoſed of thoſe three Bodies which make <hi>Architecture</hi> admired. The great Pillars, the beautiful Statues, the majeſtick vaſt Beams, the curious Pictures, the various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and quaint Motto's, made a heap of Wonders able to amuſe the cleareſt underſtanding.</p>
               <p>It contained Twenty thouſand Spectators, and had Six moving Machines in its vaſt hollow bulk, every one of which made a Scene. In them <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> was repreſented in Hell, playing on his Harp
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180450:16"/>for <hi>Euridices</hi> recovery; <hi>Theſeus</hi> in the labyrinth when he killed the Minotaure; The ſame when he deſerted <hi>Ariana</hi> in the Iſland; <hi>Circes</hi> transforming her Lovers into Beaſts; <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> retreating from the Muſick of the <hi>Syrens;</hi> and <hi>Arion</hi> ſaving himſelf on the back of the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Acts were ſeconded with moſt excellent enterludes of Muſick. The Spectators were amazed in that maner, that many learned men thought it neceſſary to deliver them to poſterity in Books.</p>
               <p>The patern of thoſe Repreſentations (being afterwards by thoſe ancient times, delivered from one another, to our days) was laſtly ſeen to flouriſh in the Feaſts of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Highneſſes of <hi>Parma;</hi> the Machines of whoſe Nuptials, if they wholly exceeded not thoſe of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> exceeded them at leaſt in having there preſent one <hi>Claudio Achillini,</hi> whoſe admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, not onely with the harmony of Order, but likewiſe the deſign of the Carpenters work, perpetually made them famous.</p>
               <p>Other pleaſant Shows ſucceeded the former, and <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for the ſpace of a moneth appeared the Worlds delight.</p>
               <p>When that time was expired, <hi>Demetrius</hi> (to eaſe <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Country of the inconveniencies cauſed by his Army, and to carry back his Navy to the Havens of his Kingdom) took his leave of his dear Daughter, and his new Son-in-law, and returned with <hi>Fila</hi> to <hi>Tripolis,</hi> where he embarked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> felt their departure with that grief,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180450:16"/>which was taught her by the Law of filial affection. And while ſhe was alone in her Chamber, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their voyage with her ſorrow, <hi>Antiochus</hi> came to ſee her.</p>
               <p>He ſaw her (ah ſight!) he ſaw her in that poſture, which would have mollified a Flint.</p>
               <p>Her Face was ſo ſweetly full of pity, that even ſorrow it ſelf looked well in thoſe Cheeks. The fire of her looks, though bathed in ſadneſs, was not leſſened at all; but albeit it burned in the water, yet it could not be ſaid to be artificial fire. It was too natural to <hi>Stratonica</hi> to burn him with her looks.</p>
               <p>It is hard to deſcribe with what affection thoſe eyes big with grief brought forth tears. The fair Queen in that act reſembled <hi>Aurora</hi> in travel of the day. Her tears much exceeded the morning dew in Beauty.</p>
               <p>To hear her name pitifully her Father, ſo wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of the Prince, that the hurt was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>He beholding ſo pleaſing a ſight, was wholly tranſported with her Face, and began to conſider more ſeriouſly <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s great Beauty.</p>
               <p>That his pity (which he felt pierce his heart) was the Embryo, of which, by little and little, Love afterwards came to be formed.</p>
               <p>It was but Reaſon, that what began of Pity, ſhould make an end in Love. And it was a lucky ſign to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his love, that it began of grief.</p>
               <p>Joy and Sorrow are the two Centers of all humane
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180450:17"/>Actions. He that begins with the one, ends neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> undertook to comfort the Queen, and ſo affectionately comforted her, that he even kept her company in weeping.</p>
               <p>His Compaſſion aſſured her of his Love, and her Sympathy and Affection to him from thence increaſed infinitely.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of that afflicted Beauty was a Key, which opened to <hi>Antiochus</hi> the door of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. From that time, ever after, when he looked on <hi>Stratonica,</hi> her Beauty ſeemed greater to him, and her Behavior more pleaſing. He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nothing but her Converſation. To be the mark of her Looks, and the eccho of her words, repreſented to him the felicities of Paradiſe. Now <hi>Antiochus</hi> was grown almoſt a Lover, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not that he loved.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who ſaw that in all Feaſts, and particularly in the Balls, and in Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Antiochus</hi> alone was reputed the moſt valiant, and eſteemed the moſt handſom; conſidering too no leſs, the moſt pleaſing and amorous diſpoſitions of his nature, was by little and little ſo enamored of him, that ſhe acted more the part of a Lover then a Friend.</p>
               <p>Reputation in Arms, is a very great motive to Love.</p>
               <p>Women, as deprived of that excellency (in this unlike themſelves) envy not Valor, but admire it in Men.</p>
               <p>They hate ſo much Feminine weakneſs, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180450:17"/>they cannot love the man that is Effeminate; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſubject to man, they cannot without bluſhing endure to be commanded by him, who cannot ſhew himſelf to be more then a woman.</p>
               <p>So by little and little, the Fire fortified it ſelf in the two Princes hearts.</p>
               <p>But the flames were ſo great in <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, that there was no hope of remedy, unleſs ſhe would diſcover them. If either Love ſhewed her <hi>Antiochus</hi> in Armor in the Field, to ſhew his Valor, or if he preſented him to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed in the middle of a Ball, to make a new Conqueſt with his Graces, his preſence had ſtill the ſame power, either this way or that to unbowel her.</p>
               <p>The Unfortunate Lady ſang frequently with him, and perhaps compoſed the Songs in order to her Paſſion; but Art could do nothing where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not help.</p>
               <p>She was now ſo far gone in her Love, that it either would have ſhortly cauſed her death, or forced her to ſpeak; but Love very ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her from the danger ſhe was in.</p>
               <p>She received advice, That <hi>Fauſtus</hi> her Father was dead, and that ſhe as his ſole Daughter, was left Heir of a large Country; that therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned her (in the company of her Coſen <hi>Periander,</hi> who was come to convey her from the Court) to reſolve to depart.</p>
               <p>She retired into her Chamber at that news, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded in a moment with a Million of thoughts tormenting her Minde. Her ſerene Brow was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180450:18"/>the colour of her Face turned Pale, her Eyes wept abundantly, her Breaſt ſighed aloud, and ſhe in an inſtant was made an unfortunate Winter of Affliction.</p>
               <p>She felt her Fathers death by the abſence of her Lover; ſhe felt her Lovers abſence by the death of her Father: One grief encreaſed with the memory of another, and in the Aſhes of that, the Fire of this kindled apace.</p>
               <p>It is no little Happineſs to one that is unhappy, to vent without ſcandal his Torments, when his Torments are derived from a Cauſe, which may occaſion Scandal.</p>
               <p>The Minde of <hi>Sophonisba</hi> (over-flown with the torrent of ſuch Sorrows) could not chooſe but tranſport her to a firm Reſolution of diſcovering her ſelf to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtate of that Lover ſeems to her too unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, who is ſilent and far off. She therefore ſought occaſion to be with him alone; but when ſhe is beginning to ſpeak, affrighted with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Face ſhe adores, little more then half alive ſhe congeals and grows mute.</p>
               <p>The Prince took no notice of her Paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was ſtill to be unhappy. She ſeeing ſhe had loſt ſo fit an opportunity, knew not how with any thing to puniſh more her ſelf, then by going away preſently.</p>
               <p>'Twas now night when ſhe began to take her leave of all.</p>
               <p>'Twas fit a black Licence ſhould forerun ſo dark a Voyage.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:180450:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> having given her a very rich Jewel, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her on the fore-head.</p>
               <p>All happineſs go with thee <hi>Sophonisba.</hi> The Gods know (he ſaid to her) what a loſs my Court hath of thy Preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> wept, and embraced her oftentimes; onely <hi>Antiochus</hi> wiſhed her a good journey, and took his leave of her without much alteration.</p>
               <p>That was very good luck for <hi>Sophonisba:</hi> one pale look of his would have made her dye of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Having ended her Ceremonies with all, ſhe locked her ſelf in her Chamber. She went not to bed to take reſt; but after much uncertainty of minde, wrote a Letter to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and delivered it to one ſhe loved well in the Court called <hi>Eleuteria,</hi> entreating her to give it into his hands, when ſhe gueſſed ſhe might be a little way off from <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The morning being come, <hi>Aurora</hi> ſcarce bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſhe with her Company took Coach, and ſet forwards on their journey.</p>
               <p>The diſconſolate Lady was glad, that then all the Court was aſleep, that ſhe might meet no more of thoſe Objects, which would cauſe her to weep. She concealed her ſelf in her funeral Coach, leſt the Objects ſhe might ſee, ſhould ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove her of her diſtance from <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleuteria</hi> about noon ſuppoſing <hi>Sophonisba</hi> was far enough off, found <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and preſented him with the Letter. He bluſhed a little at it, yet thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Eleuteria,</hi> and locking himſelf in his Chamber, opened it, and read as here followeth:</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:180450:19"/>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>I <hi>Am too bold, O</hi> Antiochus. <hi>To write then to you when I may ſpeak, is not always a ſign of Modeſty. If theſe Characters (in which my mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts like a Serpent move hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) had the force to make you penetrate what I fain would have you know, how your vertues have had the Power to make me feel what I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from all but your ſelf, I ſhould live more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you remain better ſatisfied. But what do you expect that I ſhould tell you? In what an ocean of thoughts waves your Minde while you read? Where think you will theſe rows of Words, or rather theſe Lines finde an End, which are drawn from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of my Breaſt? Alas, I want Power to expreſs it. My</hi> Antiochus, <hi>who truly art not mine, but as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent you to my ſelf. Since it was my fortune to contemplate your Vertues, and receive your Favors, Love ſo invaded me, that I could not reſiſt him by forbearing to be yours. Many Moneths are now paſt, ſince my heart hath encreaſed the number of your Vaſſals. You have commanded one Soul more then you knew of, and ſtill are Lord of it. My Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my Looks and my Words would have well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you of it, if you had made reflection on them. But I have been either too fearful, or you too negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Being content howſoever with my Fortune, which was careleſs in acquainting you with it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced as much in loving you, as another would per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>haps have rejoyced in being loved again. I was to my ſelf (as I may ſay) both the Idol and Idolater too. The Sphaer of my Fire had no greater Circumference,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180450:19"/>then what was turned about by the Circuit of a Heart. To ſee you, to ſpeak to you, and to be in your Company, were the greateſt rewards I could deſire for my Love. That Lady ſeemed too happy to me, who had leave to lay her heart in the boſom of a King. But ſince the death of</hi> Fauſtus <hi>my Father hath made unhappy the happineſs of my life, by forcing me to go from your Court, I (wounded paſt all Cure) knew not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy to have recourſe to (to preſerve me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live) but this of informing you, That I love you more then my ſelf. To love you at a diſtance, and without your knowledge, were too cruel Conditions to the Fortune of one ſo unhappy as I am. I muſt either have died, or informed you of it. To have done it with my tongue, would have been more pleaſing to me, with my Pen it hath been ſafer. If you ſhould have refuſed me, I ſhould have died of grief; if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of me, of delight. Either this way or that I muſt have died, if ſhe be ſaid to dye, who is Crowned with a triumph or Martyrdom. Be not ſcandalized my King. A woman that ſo long hath known how to be ſilent, would have known ne'er to Love, if it had been in her Power.</hi>

Pity my ſorrows, which onely are mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am exceſsively yours. And remember, that I (turning ſometimes to the Heaven, under which you take your breath) will invoke that name often, which would onely make me happy if I had not occaſion to invoke it. I deſire you not to Love me, for it would be temerity to deſire ſo great a thing. I onely beſeech
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180450:20"/>you to pardon me, if thoſe offences be worthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which in nothing elſe have Wronged you but in Loving you.</hi>

               <p>Amazement ſeized <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as ſoon as he had read over the Places, which had Power to make him wonder; and, as if his Soul from that Letter had drunk ſome liquid Poyſon, he began to perceive a ſudden fire in his Bowels.</p>
               <p>An amorous Letter to a youthful Heart is a learned Enchantment. The Hooks of thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are artificial pick-lock-tools to open the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Bolt of a Heart. To ſee a Leaf written, is like ſeeing an Army in the Field; Every Line is a File of Men. Words give Battel to the Minde and overcome it, for there is no force more powerful then that of Words to batter a Minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> read over the Letter once or twice, which was a Compoſition too pleaſing to uncalm the tranquillity of his Thoughts; and cauſing <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuteria</hi> to come to him, queſtioned her earneſtly to ſee what ſhe knew elſe of <hi>Sophonisba.</hi> Thinking then again on the accident, and Love making in the Field of his Memory a Muſter of the Vertues of that Lady, he lamented much her abſence, and ſo violently fell in Love with her, as he would have repaired all his paſt negligence, if what is once paſt could ever become preſent.</p>
               <p>He omitted not to anſwer her Letter, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his anſwer many amorous Conceits, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Sophonisba</hi> that he loved her again. But his anſwer come to <hi>Burſia,</hi> was returned with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180450:20"/>That the miſerable Lady was dead.</p>
               <p>The ſorrow ſhe had for leaving her <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was the cauſe of her death. And who wonders that ſhe died leaving him, if <hi>Antiochus</hi> was her life?</p>
               <p>The Fame of her Death being ſpread through <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> all that had known her, wept for her. Every one bewayled the too untimely death of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonisba,</hi> the Sun of whoſe Vertue had given ſo much Luſtre to that Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> above all (cloathing in Black his deareſt Thoughts) erected in the Temple of his Heart, a Monument of Tears to his deceaſed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris.</p>
               <p>His ſorrows were the greater, in order to the ſtrife within himſelf to conceal them.</p>
               <p>But all he could do, could not hinder the Marks of his grief from appearing with ſtate on his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Remembrances are ſorrowful, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Heart make the Eccho of a Tomb. They have ſomething of poyſon, which fuming to the face, makes it pale. Sepulchers contain onely aſhes, and can give no other colour to him that thinks on them, but what is of aſhes.</p>
               <p>But the Mark being removed towards which the deſires of <hi>Antiochus</hi> began to run, he remained as deprived of ſenſe, becauſe he could no longer be ſenſual.</p>
               <p>The man that applies not himſelf to ſome Love, is like a Body without Life.</p>
               <p>The good Prince is unſatisfied, till he fill afreſh his heart with ſome other Affection.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:180450:21"/>
               <p>Humane Condition is of ſuch a conſtitution, that if once it loſe its modeſty in deſiring, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently becomes diſhoneſt in its Deſires.</p>
               <p>He waving up and down in theſe irreſolutions, Love preſents before him <hi>Stratonica.</hi> He before having careleſly deſigned the firſt Draughts of a Love more then filial towards her, thinks it eaſie to purſue it, until it degenerate into luſt. He therefore begins to wiſh to ſee her, and is pleaſed with her favors. But return'd to himſelf, it is probable that he ſaid oftentimes to himſelf,</p>
               <p>What ways are theſe? Whither runneſt ſo <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus?</hi> Doſt thou invent Treaſons? Treaſon's the more hainous, ſince they are againſt Honor? Can thy Heart have a corner where a Thought may hide it ſelf; a Thought that is ſo foul to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer to thy Father? And liveſt thou, and breatheſt? And haſt the impudence (wicked wretch) to endure the others looks? And on what are founded all thy Hopes, though they are juſt Hopes? Perhaps on <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s allurements? And thinkeſt thou that ſhe flatters thee laſciviouſly? Mad-man that thou art, canſt not be faithleſs enough thy ſelf, unleſs thou likewiſe thinkeſt Fidelity it ſelf faithleſs?</p>
               <p>With theſe or the like internal Motions, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> mortifying his Senſes, ſtopt the courſe of his Affection to the Queen, and was afterwards more cautious, and leſs careful to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>She ſeeing him grown tepid and ſad, was not wanting to make uſe of all occaſions to rekindle his Affection.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:180450:21"/>
               <p>And he (after ſome little reſiſtance) returned to the Happineſs of her Favors, and began to deſire them afreſh very paſſionately.</p>
               <p>So the courſe of his Affections altered by turn, till after ſome days <hi>Antiochus</hi> arrived at that point of his Life, in which a Change of Fortune was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed him by his Fate.</p>
               <p>On the ſide of the Pallace, <hi>Seleucus</hi> had a Garden no leſs ſpacious then beautiful: In it, as in a leavy <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> or an Academy of Plants well looked to, the vegetative Creatures taught men the Sciences of the moſt learned Beauties. There in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the King uſed to walk in the Evening, and to Sup oftentimes.</p>
               <p>One Evening therefore among the reſt, being there at Table with the Queen and the Prince, they were infinitely merry.</p>
               <p>It was in that part of the year, when the World (become yong again) uſes with flowry Hair to array his naked Face. To ſee <hi>Stratonica</hi> in a Garden, was to ſee the Sun in his Sphaer. That Garden ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Epitome of all the Worlds Beauty, and <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s face the Epitome of that Garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> (grown drunk with the pleaſure of a thouſand little flatteries of the Queen) was no ſooner a Bed, but diſordered his minde with a Chaos of Thoughts now unquiet, now calm, and penetrating into the Contemplation of what had paſſed that day, ſighed to himſelf through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Compaſſion, and cryed out often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>Sweeteſt <hi>Stratonica!</hi> And who would be happier
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180450:22"/>then I am, if what thou doſt to me as a Mother-in-law, thou wouldſt do as a Lover?</p>
               <p>In theſe or ſuch like words he continued, and his Senſes being fettered with the ſoft ſnares of ſleep, he dreamed in the night, That paſſing through the Garden, he had found <hi>Stratonica</hi> all alone in a labyrinth of Mirtles, which grew there in the middle. The afflicted Queen being ſeated (as he thought) in thoſe ſhady retreats, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wept.</p>
               <p>What ails you Madam? Why weep you ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolately?</p>
               <p>She then looking on <hi>Antiochus</hi> with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance between angry and pleaſed, ſeemed thus to anſwer him,</p>
               <p>Cruel man! Art ſtill ſo inhumane to ask me why I weep? I ſo long have been dying for thy love, and thou returneſt not my kindneſs, nor makeſt account of it, and yet thou askeſt me why I weep?</p>
               <p>The Prince (congealing at thoſe words) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and ſenſleſs. Having afterwards by little and little recovered his ſpirits, he endeavored to mitigate her Sorrow, by aſſuring her, That he ſuffered as much for her ſake.</p>
               <p>The Dream wrought ſo powerfully, that <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> awaked. Being come to himſelf, O Gods (ſaid he) who can tell if <hi>Stratonica</hi> loves thee not unfeignedly? who can tell? But Fool, what ſay I? Is <hi>Stratonica</hi> falſe to my Father? Ah! theſe are diſtempers of a youthful Brain, they are diſtempers.</p>
               <p>So he reaſoned with himſelf, and leaping out of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180450:22"/>his Bed (when the Sun had now gilded the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows) came into the Room, where he uſed every morning to do his duty to the Queen.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Antiochus,</hi> how near is thy Liberty to an end?</p>
               <p>Round that Preſence-Chamber, from the top, hung rich imbroidered Cloth, the height of which (being adorned with a circle of Pictures done by rare Maſters) entertained the Eyes of all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders with a very ſtately Sight. On one of the four ſides, on a Table of Silver, was erected to the middle of the Wall, a very great and clear four-ſquare Looking-glaſs, which reſembling a calm Sea, bounded with the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> ſhore of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Ebony, invited all the Faces and Species of near Objects to fail on its Boſom.</p>
               <p>Now while <hi>Stratonica,</hi> the King, and many other domeſticks (which coming from their Chambers, had aſſembled there themſelves) ſtood diſcourſing on the reſt they had taken the night paſt; the Queen (who was afraid to be obſerved by her Husband, if too often, as ſhe otherwiſe would have done, ſhe had fixed her Eyes on her beloved) learned to look kindly upon him by ſtealth in the Image, which the Glaſs reflected of him: ſo while ſhe was ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted with his ſight, <hi>Antiochus</hi> by chance caſting his eyes up and down, found the Queens fixed on him.</p>
               <p>But who can now repeat the great force of that encounter of their looks? And how ſignificant was that ſudden correſpondence of their eyes? It was the Work of an Angel, that ſhe in an inſtant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180450:23"/>aſſured, reproved, and encouraged the enamored Prince.</p>
               <p>If thou doubteſt that I love thee (he thought that thoſe Eyes ſaid to him) if thou doubteſt that I love thee, O <hi>Antiochus,</hi> behold this my Soul, which wholly contracted in the little circle of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Apple of the Eye, hopes onely to be helped by a dying Aſpect. To aſſure thee of my Love, me-thinks the many ſigns thou haſt had of my Affection, ſhould ſuffice thee. But ſince thou wouldſt never credit them, nor beleeve the laſt Nights Viſion, wilt thou credit this Glaſs? Ah, ſee <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſee that I love thee.</p>
               <p>The Eyes are the Wonders of the Face, and dark Figures of Divinity. We may call them too the Dyals of Love, which faſtned on the Wall of a Countenance, ſhew with the Style of their Looks, the minutes of hours, either happy or unhappy to Lovers. They ſhewed Love-ſick <hi>Antiochus</hi> that infallibly from that Moment, by aſſuring himſelf of <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Affection, he burnt in that maner, that his Flame was almoſt after paſt extinguiſhing.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow the Heart of <hi>Antiochus</hi> was combuſtible Matter. The form of that Look ſo kindled the Fire in his Bowels, that he being unable to contain it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in his Boſom, it likewiſe fell to flaming in his Face.</p>
               <p>Philoſophy hath no Secret that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the firſt Paſſions of the Minde. They invade with that violence, that they tyrannize.</p>
               <p>Poor Lovers amongſt their Miſeries, count not for the leaſt, that of Bluſhing, and frequently grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pale, becauſe in the colours diſplayed on their Cheeks by their Minde, they cannot help declaring thoſe Affections, which they would moſt conceal.</p>
               <p>But Nature that hath contracted the univerſe in man, hath placed in his Face the eccho of his Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> his bluſhing, made <hi>Stratonica</hi> bluſh too; for ſhe could have no ſign that he was aware of her Affection without being aſhamed.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:180450:24"/>
               <p>The Prince therefore taking notice, that his ſtay there was dangerous to that Secreſie, which he too much had profeſſed in all his Actions; he took his leave of her, and (running like a wounded Stag) took covert again in thoſe Chambers, which (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the green Pictures and Tapiſtries) differed in nothing from Foreſts, but in that they were Painted.</p>
               <p>There tranſported in an amorous Extaſie, he frequently lay in the trance of a thouſand Delights. Between him alone, and his heart, was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which in caſes like this, is eaſier phanſied then deſcribed. He was ſo well pleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſeemed a Courtier complementing with a Friend.</p>
               <p>All that while his fair Mother-in-law was no leſs pleaſed then he, onely ſhe could not have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perfect her Joy, by reaſon of her Ladies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, who were always waiting on her.</p>
               <p>But they limited the Violence of their Joy, with a reciprocal Deſire of reſeeing one another that Morning, before they went to Dinner, to return to the Cement of thoſe Looks, with which their Souls had begun to be acquainted.</p>
               <p>So when the inundation of Bluſhing had ceaſed in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Face, he went out well compoſed, and being come thither where he had left <hi>Stratoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> before, he found her ſtanding there, and reading certain Letters from her Father, which ſhe newly had received.</p>
               <p>Days which begin luckily, ſeldom end unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Diſaſters and Joyes uſe commonly to come
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180450:24"/>ſingle. The beginning it ſeems infuſes certain Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities into things, with which it does either vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or infect them.</p>
               <p>It was a day of Felicity to the two enamored Princes. It began with the Private, and was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the publike Joy.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Letters brought advice, That <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> having cauſed <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Antipater</hi> to be ſlain, who lay in wait for his life, was by the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (the deceaſeds Subjects) ſaluted for their King, and conducted into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> very glad of the news, gave order that <hi>Seleucus</hi> ſhould be called in all haſte, and in the mean time communicated it to <hi>Antiochus</hi> with ſo pleaſing a Countenance, that in it he had more things to read then in the Paper.</p>
               <p>The yong Prince tranſported with the joy of that pleaſant geſture, if once he looked down on the Letter, often lifted up his eyes to look the Queen in the Face. In the end, having heard what the Letters contained, he cryed out, and expreſſing great contentment, ſaid to her,</p>
               <p>I wonder not (Madam) that Kingdoms owe their Being to the valor of your Father; I wonder that the Subjects of ſlain <hi>Alexander</hi> knew not how to revenge their Kings death, but by giving the Crown of his Kingdom to his Murtherer.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I confeſs (deareſt Prince) anſwered <hi>Stratonica,</hi> That if this news had not been written to me by my Fathers own hand, I ſhould not have beleeved it; howſoever, the ſtranger it is,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180450:25"/>the more it hath repleniſhed me with Joy.</p>
               <p>From whence (replyed <hi>Antiochus</hi>) we onely may argue, That King <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Merits are ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that Fortune afraid of their greatneſs, hath turned into peaceable Scepters their vindicative Swords, and changed Blood-thirſty Wars into Vaſſallages full of Devotion. If therefore his Friends and his Servants are bound to rejoyce for his Victories, I (amongſt them all who am the moſt obliged to him, as well for his Valor, as the Intereſts (Madam) which I have in your perſon) cannot do leſs then kiſs your Hand to ſhew you my Gladneſs:</p>
               <p>And bowing himſelf, he deſired to kiſs it. But <hi>Stratonica</hi> making a pleaſing reſiſtance, very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſmiling, returned him this Anſwer;</p>
               <p>Prince, I will never permit you to be ſo obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to me, I am very ſure that your Joy for my Fathers proſperity equals mine; wherefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary for you to aſſure me of it otherwiſe then you do by your Countenance.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Antiochus</hi> perſiſting in his deſire to kiſs her Hand, at laſt overcoming her, kiſſed it.</p>
               <p>I beleeve (O <hi>Antiochus</hi>) the Repulſes of thy beautiful Queen, were the uſual tricks of witty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Peradventure for the ſweetneſs of thy kiſs, ſhe wiſhed then her mouth on her hand.</p>
               <p>But thou wouldſt have been certainly very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if thou couldſt with that kiſs have buried thy life in one of thoſe fair little Graves.</p>
               <p>While they were ſo diſcourſing, <hi>Seleucus</hi> came to them, and informed with emulation now by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180450:25"/>
                  <hi>Stratonica,</hi> now by <hi>Antiochus</hi> of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his good fortune, he ſeemed externally to be very glad of it, but really within himſelf he was very ſorry for it.</p>
               <p>Men applaud, but fear his Greatneſs, who is able to ſuppreſs them. Princes like Plants cannot endure the height of thoſe Trees which can ſhade them. Every one hates in his Companion that happineſs, which he fain would have himſelf, and continually ſeeking to ballance anothers power, comes many times to loſe his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> howſoever to conceal his own reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, gave order the ſame morning for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a very Solemn Feaſt, where by the number of the Lords which were to be preſent, the quality of his Love (which he fained to his Father in law) might appear the more Glorious.</p>
               <p>Tables (like Tragical Scenes) uſe oftentimes to kill noyſom Thoughts with the death of Meats. And thoſe cares which (ſayling on the Ocean of the Minde) are affraid to loſe themſelves, being plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the little Lake of a foaming Chriſtal, ſuffer often Shipwrack.</p>
               <p>Man hath no Theater more delightful to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all his Senſes then a Table, and nothing more hurtful to his health, or more ſcandalous to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior.</p>
               <p>The Fame of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his good Fortune, and the order for the Banquet being ſpread through the Court, the joy was univerſal in all Hearts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theirs, who profeſſed themſelves the Subjects and Dependants of that King. Among them <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cofronia</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:180450:26"/>a Lady well in years, and <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s nurſe, made ſhew of great contentment.</p>
               <p>She was at that time the greateſt among thoſe near the Queen. <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who had ſucked her Milk, had likewiſe ſucked the Cuſtom of reſpecting her as a Mother. The Authority in her Face e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled that of her State. No Lady ſpake more eloquently, and none led a more unblemiſhed Life.</p>
               <p>In thoſe joyes (which were the cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and Whiſperings) the two enamored Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could very well mingle their pleaſures, without running the hazard of being obſerved; for the Ladies, the Pages, and other Domeſticks of the Court, being buſie about one thing or other, had no time to ſtand ſtill, and take notice of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Patrons.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Seleucus</hi> (when he had conferred ſome time with the Queen about the news of his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, and the preparations for the Feaſt) retired into his uſual Lodgings, the better to attend the Affairs of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> (to give no ſuſpition of himſelf, with his being continually with his Mother-in-law) did the ſame; The Gods know with what Minde. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Threſhold of the Door, which locked his Heart from him, he turned himſelf to ſee his Life which remained there within, and he ſaw her ſtand looking on him.</p>
               <p>Farewel they ſaid, in that encounter of their Looks. Heaven knows how I depart, Love knows how I ſtay here.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:180450:26"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> went away full of Joy, but what cauſed his Affliction to depart from his Happineſs. He goes through thoſe Rooms, he wanders through the Galleries of the Pallace ſo tranſported; that ſaluted, he returns not the Civility; that met with, he is ignorant of the Perſon: He anſwers when he is not ſpoken to, and asks Queſtions when alone.</p>
               <p>Love is the Wine of the Soul. He muſes on the world of the Looks he had received: He repeats the words that followed, and his deſtiny laſtly (whether to make him turn Phyſitian, or to diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per him, I know not) makes him a careful Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt of the Body of every little Favor.</p>
               <p>When he had muſed enough, and concluded with himſelf, that he was very much in <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Favor, he was pleaſed to ſpeak to ſome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, to paſs with the Diſcourſe of divers things that ſhort morning, which before dinner came, ſeemed to him an Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> in the mean time (who raved in her Thoughts no leſs then he) reſolved to appear to <hi>Antiochus</hi> more glorious that morning, and (to honor the Feaſt with the ſtatelieſt ſhow which ſhe could repreſent of her ſelf) to be regally adorned.</p>
               <p>To that end, being gone into her Cabinet with two diligent Chamber-Maids, ſhe ſate down by a Table the Pediſtal of a Looking-glaſs, which within the Frame of enamelled Silver, ſeemed as if it came to beatifie that Face, in which there is not a Heart that feels not a thouſand Beatitudes.</p>
               <p>But here I confeſs, I would fain know how to deſcribe her. The dalliances of a Pen which are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180450:27"/>delightful, would not be ingrateful to me in this occaſion. It was too ſtrange to the World, to ſee a Looking-glaſs look in a face, and a Woman run no leſs the danger of Idolizing then Deifying her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> could in nothing ſhew more her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then in looking on her ſelf at that time. Being ready to be enamored of her ſelf, ſhe omitted to do it, becauſe ſhe would not be a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of her ſelf to her Dear.</p>
               <p>The Queen (though ſhe had no need to inſtruct in any Action her Countenance, to ſet out her Graces more lively) yet ſtudied how her laughter might be pleaſinger, her looks more compaſſionate, and her face more attractive.</p>
               <p>It is the diſeaſe of all handſom Women (though Nature hath enriched them with her gifts) to be begging ſtill of Art thoſe Affectations which infect their Beauties often.</p>
               <p>Looking-glaſſes are Magick Books to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; They learn in them thoſe Spells, which (to charm a man) become ſweetly cruel. A Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs hath the Quality of a Counſellor, and a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge granted to no Counſellor, and a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge granted to no Counſellor, it ſpeaks always the truth, and is always beloved.</p>
               <p>While therefore <hi>Stratonica</hi> was either the Glaſs, or looked in it, the Chamber Maids began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin her Head, and untangle the Knots of Ribbands, which rowled up together in the folds of her Hair, ſerved either to bridle their Boldneſs, or bury their Errors, their Boldneſs or Errors committed in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Lovers Souls.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:180450:27"/>
               <p>The Queens Hair like a deluge over-flowed her Neck and her Face, to hinder peradventure with their inundation the Looking-glaſs from ſilvering its Chryſtal in the whiteneſs of that fleſh.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe was combed, ſhe waſhed her Face with a Water, which diſtilled from many Herbs, was in opinion with thoſe Chamber-Maids, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Vertue to make fairer the skin. I ſay in Opinion, becauſe in reality though its Vertue had been ſuch, yet it could not do any thing in her Beauty, which (an infinity having filled all places) had rendered incapable of any Augmentation. Howſoever, they began with this Water, and they ended with this Water all their Painting in <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi>'s face.</p>
               <p>She to ſo many Prerogatives had from Heaven, added that of not being an Alchymiſt. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever went to ſpy in the ſecreteſt Repoſitory of her Cabinet, found not there a world of little Boxes (not to ſay Crucibles) in which moſt Women think to finde the Stone of Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> knew very well, that in the elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of thoſe diſtilled Labyrinths, nothing would be gotten in the end, but the colour of Coals on the Teeth, and the wrinkles of burning on the Skin.</p>
               <p>When the Chamber-Maids had done waſhing her Face, they fell to ordering her Hair. Its trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time was as ſtately as it was new.</p>
               <p>On the Crown of her Head, like a glorious Diadem, was a circle of Treſſes of Hair adorned with Diamonds; in the middle of which (looking towards the height of her forehead) was placed a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180450:28"/>Jewel of an extravagant faſhion, the greateſt Gem of which, was a very large Carbuncle reduced into the Figure of a wounded Heart. Two thick Locks of curled Hair hung on her Temples, within which (as it were in living Cages) the ſoft Thoughts of Lovers played like little Birds. She had for her Pendants two little cluſters of Grapes, which (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Jewel) had ſparkling Stones. Then from the top of the plaited Rowl, hung looſe a fine Vail inter-woven with Silver, which ſwoln with the Air of Ambition, that it had in ſerving for ſo No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a uſe, fell waving to hide the hinder part of her Head, and came down to the back of the Queen.</p>
               <p>Being adorned in this maner, ſhe from the Neck upwards, reſembled very well a Spring full of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when in a clear Morning it is ſeen overcaſt with a little thin cloud.</p>
               <p>When her Head was artificially dreſſed, they brought her a Silk Gown from the Wardrobe, in which the Weavers Shittle had moſt fortunately aſſembled all the Colours and Figures of the Wheel, in which the ſtately Peacock turns about the pride of his Feathered Beauty. The Gold mingled with the Jewels (with which ſhe was richly adorned) fell ſhort of the firſt Quality of its worth. She, perfumed with Amber and Musk, had taken ſuch deep ſcent, that for a good ſpace breathing fine fragrancies on the circuit about her, ſhe made every breath of air of incomparable value. Moreover, the faſhion uſed then by the Queens was ſo proper to make them ſeem handſom, that ſhe could not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180450:28"/>deſire more of Art, whoſe end is to further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> being dreſſed, and thoſe Jewels diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, ſome to her Breaſt, and others to her Neck, to make all that ſaw her more dearly prize her ſight, ſhe attentively ſtood to ſee what opinion of her dreſſing the Looking-glaſs would have.</p>
               <p>What wouldſt thou have elſe, O <hi>Stratonica,</hi> of Nature and Art? See freely with all diligence, if by chance this or that have been wanting in any thing that you can deſire. The miracle of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which no where elſe is ſeen, with what a miracle now may be ſeen in you alone? What is this heap of Beauty like, with which in an inſtant you affront ſo the weakneſs of a Chryſtal? It is comelier, and more terrible then an Army ſhining all in Steel. Poor Lovers, why do ye not rather beleeve it then die?</p>
               <p>So it ſeemed that in <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Breaſt a Thought ſaid to her, which ſhe her ſelf knew not if it was hers, or of her <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be armed in that maner with Ornaments, that her Beauty was about to be Cruel, ſeemed to her a ſin of Homicide. She conſidered, that the Bowels of a Lover were too weak to reſiſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of Joy, which a preſence of that nature muſt occaſion; and that man uſed no leſs to die of Joy then of Sorrow. To have ſo much Authority in her Face, and ſo much grace in her Looks to offer violence to Affections, ſeemed not fit Qualities for her, who deſired to be rather a Queen then a Tyrant. She knew very well that the Soul of her
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180450:29"/>Dear had ſworn voluntary ſubjection to her, and that to compel his Affection (which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde-hand of it ſelf) was to hazard him to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, or condemn him to die quickly.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations could not be debated in the minde of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> without cauſing her to alter. The Alteration dy'd her with a Bluſhing, which was cauſed by pity. She who in the Glaſs deſires to be leſs Fair, the leſs to afflict him that loves her, when by her new colour ſhe perceives her Deſire is derided, with an Alas full of Anger, throws away the Chryſtal far from her, and turns her back on the Cabinet.</p>
               <p>A Womans condition would be too diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if ſhe had not ſome natural gift to ballance the endowments of man. Nature therefore gave her Beauty, that it might be as uſeful to her, as Strength is to a man. But becauſe to be Fair, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported too much to the Nature of Man, and to be ſtrong, to that of Woman; ſhe ſo tempered theſe two Qualities, that changing the colour, ſhe made the Strong ſeem Fair, and the Fair Strong; Strength that is not Beautiful to allure, and Beauty that is not ſtrong to overcome; neither truly can we ſay it is Beautiful, nor with Reaſon affirm it is Strong.</p>
               <p>Now the Ladies that were invited beginning to appear, the Queen gloriouſly Adorned, went out of her own into the Preſence-chamber to receive them; and being ſeated under a very rich Cloth of State, with a Circle about her of her Nobleſt Maids of Honor, cauſed all that were then come to enter in.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:180450:29"/>
               <p>The Ladies from one to another were amazed to ſee, that thinking to do their Duties to a Queen, they were encountered with the Majeſty of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs there ſeated. The fear and alteration in their Ceremonies made it very conſpicuous, that the Soul affrighted with the ſight of ſo much Beauty, abandoning onely all the parts of the Body, was in the little Circle of the Apple of the Eye weakly fortified.</p>
               <p>The uſual ſigns of Reverence and Affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made and received, all of them ſate down in order to their Condition and Quality.</p>
               <p>They ſpake not at firſt, for the Spirits which (to manifeſt their joy for <hi>Demetrius</hi> his encreaſe of good Fortune ſhould have run to the tongue) were all employed in their eyes, in gazing with delight on the wonders of <hi>Stratonica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Silence too augmented the qualities of that Beauty, whoſe firſt Quality was to infuſe a Silence.</p>
               <p>The Ladies beheld <hi>Stratonica,</hi> and having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, beheld one another. The amazement which every one ſhewed, ſerved to her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Teſtimony, to aſſure her that ſhe ſaw no illuſion.</p>
               <p>Every thing was admirable in the Queen; but that was moſt admirable, that her Beauty ſerved not, but commanded the Beauty of Art. That rule failed in her of beautified Arts, That the more they are Adorned, the leſs they Delight.</p>
               <p>The artificial Lights could not be ſo powerful as to darken the Rayes of natural Brightneſs. In vain the Stars in a ſerene Night put themſelves in order to dazle the Moon.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:180450:30"/>
               <p>At laſt the Bridle of their Tongue being given them, an Encomium with a very low humming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſound among them, which (reſembling an amorous Bee) went about, producing in the ears of this and that Lady an Affection of Honey. They contended all gladly in exerciſing their Fancies on that Beauty, whoſe Fancies by too Fatal a Decree were onely reſerved for <hi>Seleucus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſaid <hi>Demetrius</hi> was Happy, becauſe he was Father to ſo fair a Princeſs; they ſaid <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> was Glorious, becauſe ſhe was daughter to ſo renowned a King.</p>
               <p>Her Beauty added Splendor to his Arms, and his Arms augmented the Fame of her Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fila</hi> was invoked and envied together for the Fortunat'ſt Woman then living, and onely was pitied for her dear Daughters diſtance.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like things were quietly mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and thought on by the Ladies; when the Queen aware of their Conceits, and unwilling to hear her ſelf praiſed (though it were but with a thought) broke the thread of their diſcourſe, and began now with one, now with another, to ſpeak of ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Sergeants which aſſiſted at the Banquet, came in to inform them that all things were ready. At that ſaying the Queen roſe up, deſirous peradventure now at laſt to feed her amorous eyes with the dear ſight of her beloved <hi>Antiochus.</hi> All the Ladies roſe up with her, and while they were Complementing together about precedence in going, a Page came to the Queen to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180450:30"/>give her notice, that <hi>Seleucus</hi> ſtaid to ſpeak with her in the Chamber. <hi>Stratonica</hi> fained to go away about ſome other occaſion, and ſuddenly went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where her old husband like a yong Lover at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her.</p>
               <p>So fine without telling me any thing? So Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious without firſt of all acquainting your <hi>Seleucus</hi> with your Bravery? Ah! what ſee I? What Deity tranſports me? And here making of his Arms an animated Chain about the Neck of his beloved, he kiſſed her with ſuch ardency, that the kiſs (as it were changing Nature) ſeemed an offence. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonica</hi> rekiſſed him many times, more moved I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with Compaſſion then Love, and gave him this anſwer: My Beauty (my Lord, if it be ſo that I am beautiful) aims at nothing elſe but your Pleaſure. Theſe gay Dreſſings (whoſe greateſt Art is Negligence) may onely call happy the Day that they are not neglected by you. If I had dared to have called you this morning a ſpectator to that Theater, where your Majeſty (it ſeems) is pleaſed to be Conquered by my Weakneſs, my Joy would have been much more pleaſing to me then any till now I have felt.</p>
               <p>Theſe words ſhe intermingled with kiſſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with them as with ſo many Seals to authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her ſayings, or to equal with number what ſhe failed of in the quality of her kiſſes to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>He thinking of no other Contentment, would have willingly entertained himſelf with that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if <hi>Stratonica</hi> telling him that the Ladies ſtaid
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180450:31"/>for him, had not haſtned him to dinner.</p>
               <p>The Room appointed for the Feaſt was very large: the Roof glittering with leave-works of Gold, loſt its eſteem in the value of the Mettle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſurpaſſed it in the richneſs of the work.</p>
               <p>The Furniture was ſo Stately, that the Walls in a maner grew proud, that on them hung the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils greateſt Glories, and the famouſeſt Labors of the Shittle. The Eye dazled with the Tiſſues, and amazed with the Silks, knew not which Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt to admire. The doors at which they went in, and were two, were ſeen guarded by two Wings of Halbardiers very proudly apparelled. The ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Irons which they brandiſhed in their hands, were ſo many glittering Tongues, giving notice with terror that there was the Majeſty of a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selencus</hi> and <hi>Stratonica</hi> entered in ſeverally, and almoſt together; he accompanied by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and his Courtiers, ſhe attended by the Ladies, and her own Maids of Honor.</p>
               <p>The Proviſion, the Muſick and Odours, ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Senſes of all that went in with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Confuſion of Pleaſure, that every one was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious for a time, and unable to determine if what he ſaw and heard was a Dream or a Truth.</p>
               <p>Unhappy <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and what a Glorious Scene is prepared thee by Fortune, to exerciſe the Acts of thy unfortunate Love?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Seleucus</hi> had ſaluted all the Ladies, and the Queen, and ended his Ceremonies with the Lords, who received one another with various demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of affection, he commanding a Silence in all, began thus to ſpeak.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:180450:31"/>
               <p>Princes, Ye cannot be ignorant of the News ſpread this morning in this Court, of the fortunate ſucceſſes of the King my Father-in-law. I unable by the ſhortneſs of a morning to demonſtrate grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joy, have invited you all to dine with me, that ye rejoycing with me for the growth of that Crown, we may drink to his health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it encreaſe,</hi> anſwered all; and with that they heard a harmony of muſical Inſtruments, which beginning a rare Tune, they ſang a certain Song uſed at the triumphs of Princes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a deluge of Diſhes overflowed the Table, in which, as in ſo many Silver Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers the Meats were brought interred, which had for their Sawces exhauſted <hi>Arabia</hi> and the <hi>India</hi>'s of their Spices.</p>
               <p>He that knows not the Delights of the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which boaſt to devour in a Bit the value of a Kingdom, cannot conceive in his minde the leaſt part of the greatneſs of this Feaſt.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a rejoycing, who is able to imagine with what ſoftneſs the Hearts of the two enamored Princes diſſolved? They, divided by their old Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val (who loved no leſs paſſionately then they did) beheld one another, and diſcourſed together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much the leſs taken notice of, by how much the more they ſaw themſelves aſſiſted by the Kings continual Preſence.</p>
               <p>Love is the greateſt Philoſopher in the world; He can tranſmute Subſtances without altering the Accidents. Theſe two Lovers change Subjection into Liberty, and no body perceives it, becauſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180450:32"/>no body can believe ſo bold a Change.</p>
               <p>Man ſecurely makes uſe of Exceſs, when the Exceſs is come to a certain kinde of Eminence, which makes it incredible.</p>
               <p>The Pleaſures of <hi>Antiochus</hi> would have been more delicious, if his Father had been abſent; but his Father being preſent, if they were not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, they were at leaſt more frequent: What they wanted in the Quality, they could make up with Number, ſince it is fatal in this world to have any thing perfect.</p>
               <p>While the glad Gueſts in that maner expected to ſatisfie themſelves with all the Pleaſures which could be adminiſtred to them by the delights of a Royal Feaſt, one of the Princes (turning his looks by accident, to behold a Picture done by <hi>Apelles,</hi> where <hi>Tereus</hi> cut out the Tongue of <hi>Philomene</hi>) gave occaſion to the King of commending it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thence paſſing from the diſcourſe of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to <hi>Philomenes</hi> ſinging, and from one Song going to another, the King commanded <hi>Gelmindo</hi> to ſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gelmindo</hi> was then the famouſeſt Muſitian of that Age. As ſoon as he had heard the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he ſtood thinking what to ſing to pleaſe them moſt; when a very fair Lady called <hi>Aurinda,</hi> one of the Gueſts, ſaid, <hi>Gelmindo</hi> knew ſome Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made by I know not what Poet, in order to <hi>Apelles,</hi> when he was in love with <hi>Campaſpe.</hi> The King hearing of it (and all being curious to hear them) commanded they ſhould be ſung preſently.</p>
               <p>Every one being ſilent, <hi>Gelmindo</hi> began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180450:32"/>the attention of their mindes by tuning the Strings of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Cittern. Then drawing from the bottom of his Breaſt, a long but ſweet Voyce, he cauſed a chilneſs to run up and down in the bones of the Auditors, which making their hair ſtand an end, and uncolouring their Cheeks, drew tears in many to the Confines of their Eyes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Preludium</hi> repreſented the guſhing of a Wave, which carrying on its back the ſoul of him that heard it, while it ran now high, now low, now ſwift, now ſlow, made it really appear that even in Muſick Tempeſts are not wanting to Shipwrack a Heart.</p>
               <p>The Verſes were theſe. They were admirable in their own language, but being transformed, have loſt very much by the traduction of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beauty.</p>

                  <hi>Gelmindo</hi> went on, and at laſt concluded his Song by telling them, That <hi>Alexander</hi> pitying <hi>Apelles,</hi> with an inimitable act of Liberality, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf of her gave him <hi>Campaſpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lovers beheld one another many times, and bluſhed at the Senſe of thoſe Verſes. The Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of what he ſung was as admirable as the Song it ſelf. A thouſand times both the one and the other reproved with their Eyes the cowardize of their Hearts. And lamenting much the time, which they had ſo unprofitably let ſlip, they encouraged themſelves to perform with all ſtudy, what the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Orator without any ſtudy had perſwaded them to.</p>
               <p>When the Feaſt was ended, divers ſorts of Games and Paſtimes (agreeing with the Majeſty of a King) were introduced for the entertainment of the Gueſts. With theſe and the Muſick, which played from time to time, they at laſt brought that day to a period, which for the many accidents that happened to <hi>Stratonica</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> was eternally Memorable.</p>
               <p>Leave being given to the Ladies and Lords to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:180450:33"/>go away, every one retired to bed. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> like one paſſing from the Active to the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life, began there to ruminate on the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Pleaſures he had enjoyed. The ſighs which intermiſſively came from his ſoul, and the ſoftneſs into which he felt his heart diſſolve, can onely be deſcribed by him, who is as he was, A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> did the ſame, and perhaps with more piercing reſentments, as ſhe who more ſenſibly then <hi>Antiochus</hi> was acquainted with amorous Delights.</p>
               <p>The Hearts of theſe two Lovers were united, their bodies disjoyned. The walls of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers too far diſtant the one from the other, were the cauſe of this bitter divorce. Their nocturnal ſtudies aimed at nothing elſe but to joyn too their bodies. To ſee that both the one and the other ſhewed the ſame deſire in the actions of the day, made them both hope that the effect would ſhortly follow. But many days paſſing away (though in them many fair opportunities were offered them) they never diſcovered their Paſſions.</p>
               <p>Fortune and Chance (eſteemed by the Ancients as Gods) playing with theſe two Lovers, gave them occaſion of crediting more their Deities. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reduced the Prince and the Queen to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that one moment onely was wanting to them to render them happy.</p>
               <p>Of what great importance is a Moment? <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonica</hi> expected, and with reaſon, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> would have begun. <hi>Antiochus</hi> not daring ſo much, thought <hi>Stratonica</hi> would have ſpoken the firſt.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:180450:34"/>Loſing in this maner their time, and driven back with that extream, which onely with a word they could have overcome, they precipitated themſelves into a Sea of a thouſand ſtrange Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The lamentations (which one without the knowledge of the other made of his condition) are incredible to him who is not a Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> now accuſtomed to bewail her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate love, uſed often to retire into her Chamber, to extinguiſh that Fire with her Tears, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was concealed) ſeemed to her the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licofronia</hi> had firſt noted many days the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Queen, and argued with her ſelf, that thoſe colours could proceed from nothing elſe but an amorous Feaver. She therefore obſerved her proceedings, and perceived at laſt that ſhe was in love with <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtrangeneſs of the Caſe ſeemed no leſs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious then horrible to her. Howſoever, being wiſe ſhe would not believe it, till ſhe firſt had had ſuch a counterſign as was capable of freeing her from all doubt. It ſeemed to her no little offence againſt the honeſty of a Princeſs, but to think her diſhoneſt.</p>
               <p>Great Perſons have always advantage in the eſteem of being good, as if the opinion of men was affraid to meaſure the height of their Fortune, with any other rule but that of Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>One day in the end as Fortune would have it, <hi>Licofronia</hi> hapned unawares to hear behinde a Hanging, a very ſad complaint made by <hi>Stratonica.</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:180450:34"/>She was about to go help her, being unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, to ſee her own Heart diſtil in flowing Tears at the Eyes of the Queen. But ſhe heard a low voice pronounce twice the name of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that ſaying, the wiſe Matron liſtned more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and ſtood a while fixed, to ſee if ſhe could underſtand the ſenſe of the words which the afflicted Queen uttered. But her Sorrow occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning an alternate change in her voice, which ſometimes was low, and ſometimes clear, her words (ere they came to <hi>Licofronia</hi>'s Ears) died among the multitude of her Sobs. She perceived how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that <hi>Stratonica</hi> lamented <hi>Antiochus</hi> his cruelty, in that he complied not with her Love in the maner ſhe deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licofronia</hi>'s amazement was ſo great, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt made her ſwoon. Being a little returned to her ſelf, ſhe was about to run diſtracted into the Chamber, to reprove the Queen ſharply, and tell her how much ſhe had degenerated from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Blood which (when ſhe was a Childe) ſhe had ſucked from her Breaſts. But remembring her ſelf, that the Remedies of the Minde were not to be applied in the fervor of Paſſion, ſhe forbore then that Office, which onely to her as to a Mother was due in all Reaſon.</p>
               <p>She therefore retired to bewail the diſaſters of a Daughter, in whom an amorous flame had obſcured all the ſplendor ſhe had formerly purchaſed in the time of her breeding.</p>
               <p>The Water of thoſe Tears quenched not the Deſire of correcting her, but ſwelled and encreaſed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180450:35"/>it in that maner, that ſhe reſolved to do it with all ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Having therefore one day found a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gotten <hi>Stratonica</hi> into a Chamber, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt of all to ſpeak gently unto her, by putting her in minde with what diligence ſhe had always ſerved her, and how affectionately loved her. Then ſhe ſhewed unto her, that as the Affection and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhe profeſſed to her, obliged her to be glad for the excellent Qualities, and gallant Behavior that ſhe ſaw in her; ſo on the other ſide they forced her to mourn, and reprove her, in caſe ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any fault. Then ſpeaking more plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, ſhe told her (and not without anger) what ſhe had diſcovered concerning her love to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> and raging as ſhe ſpake, repreſented to her how enormous it was in a Woman, to have her Heart revolt to any Love, but what was preſcribed her by Chaſtity. Deploring at laſt her own evil fortune, ſhe a thouſand times curſed that Deſtiny, which had brought her to ſee ſo much ſhame in a Daughter, whom rather then her life ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Licofronia</hi> ſpake, The Authority of her Reaſon, and the Force of Modeſty (which lightned in her Countenance with the brightneſs of Terror) made her appear in the Eyes of the Queen more then a Woman.</p>
               <p>She preſented before the Tribunal of her own Conſcience, and feeling her ſelf accuſed as guilty of Inceſt, had no cloak but that of Shame to cover her Defects.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:180450:35"/>
               <p>Her Sorrow was the greater in the act of her Repentance, in order to its ſmalneſs in the time that ſhe had committed the Errors.</p>
               <p>When the good Nurſe had ended, <hi>Stratonica</hi> (who had tryed with how many Stings a Heart is transfixed, that is not armed with the Breaſt-plate of Innocence) anſwered her droopingly, and half dejected in this maner:</p>
               <p>Mother, the love you bear me, needs no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Any notice of it is too much, ſince the length of time, and variety of Occaſions in which it hath been exerciſed, have had the power to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticate it ſo, that there is no doubt of it. I know that this Love, and the Milk you have given me, give you a priviledge to treat me in this maner, otherwiſe neither you, nor any in the World durſt have had ſo much boldneſs. But alas, what anſwer ſhall I give thee? To remember my ſelf I am a Queen, makes me not forget, that a lye muſt not be found in the tongue of Princes. If I ſhould deny to thee my Love to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> I ſhould injure my Condition, and deride thy Prudence. I confeſs my Error; for I confeſs it, I know, not to a Judge that hath Authority to judge me, but to a Maſter that hath power to correct me. I will not excuſe my fault, by attributing that to the force of the Stars, which hath been the meer election of my Will. It is true, that (I know not by what power) I have felt my ſelf often inclined to this Love, but if I had reſiſted it, what could have tyrannized over my Will? The fault is wholly mine, I alone have made the Net, in which my Reputation and Honor
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180450:36"/>have been caught in the Paſſage. Theſe Tears which I ſhed (though they dropped from my Eyes for the ſpace of an Age) would not have water enough to cleanſe my Offence. The Stains of Honor can onely be waſhed with blood. I know I deſerve all correction; I know that none living ſhould to me be a crueller tormentor then my ſelf: But ſince (to ſave my Honor) no other chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is expedient to my Perſon, but what my own Sorrow does give me, be contented, O <hi>Licofronia.</hi> Leave me not a prey to my Senſe in that maner, leſt falling into deſpair I loſe all my Senſes. Permit me to ſay (to preſerve me alive) That the Age of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Prince, is more ſuitable to mine, then the Kings my Husband. The Comelineſs of his Preſence, his Lovely Behavior, and Courteous Converſation, would have had the power to inflame the chaſteſt Breaſt. Let this be of Comfort to me (though a weak one) That ſince I have known him, and loved him, never any word (but what was honeſt) paſſed between us, nor act, but what was decent. He rather ſtill carried himſelf ſo ſevere and even towards me, that ever ſince I loved him (cruel as he was) I could never come to know if he loves me or no.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words of <hi>Stratonica</hi> were expreſſed with a Countenance, which (even in the midſt of her Torments) had the power to ſparkle a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of amorous fire towards her <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Women once come to a certain height in Love or Diſdain, which ſurpaſſes their Reaſon, they no longer are able to verifie the ſaying, That
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:180450:36"/>they are more ſubtile then men in concealing their Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licofronia</hi> aſſured by ſo great a Contrition, that <hi>Stratonica</hi> would no more relapſe into ſin, wept pitifully at her Sorrow. She comforted her as a Mother, and encouraged her as a Nurſe. She gave her much Advice, but deſired her above all things, to avoid as much as poſſibly ſhe could the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Preſence of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Love is, my Daughter (ſhe ſaid) among other Vices, as the Lyon among ſalvage Beaſts. All others are conquered by encountring and reſiſting them, this onely is conquered by flying either from it, or throwing our ſelves on the Earth. Man, like <hi>Antaeus</hi> in wreſtling with this ſtrong <hi>Hercules,</hi> while with the memory of his own vileneſs, he touches the Earth, is never overcome; but as ſoon as he ſuffers himſelf to be exalted by vanity, is choaked.</p>
               <p>The Queen admoniſhed and encouraged, went to her uſual Lodgings with ſome black and blew prints in her Eyes cauſed by weeping.</p>
               <p>Many hours had not paſſed, but it being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening, <hi>Antiochus</hi> (who longed to ſee her) according to his cuſtom came to viſit her.</p>
               <p>That trouble (I know not how to call it) which he was aware of in her Countenance, was a Proeme to the approaching Diſaſters which invaded him firſt. Being before her, and bowing unto her, the Queen did ſalute him with ſo languiſhing a ſmile, that ſhe in its weakneſs expreſſed the ſickneſs ſhe had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>The Prince aſtoniſhed at thoſe alterations, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180450:37"/>feeling his ſpirits fail him, ſate down, not as he uſed to do at other times, but out of neceſſity. And when he had rallied together ſome reliques of that Spirit which before had deſerted him, he ſaid ſomething to her, rather to ſound the Foard of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonica</hi>'s Favor, then out of a deſire (by reaſon of his Grief) to diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The Queen anſwered him as ſeverely as ſhe could, without offending the reſpect that was due to the Prince, and ſwerving from her promiſes made to <hi>Licofronia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hear her ſpeak without her accuſtomed ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſee her look without her uſual Affection, ſo affrighted the heart of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that he was about to cry out aloud; but the violence of his Sorrow (which was ready to ſpeak) was entertained with the preſence of <hi>Licofronia,</hi> who came thither on the ſudden.</p>
               <p>When the good Lover had bethought himſelf, and aſſembled ſome ſtrength from his generous Minde (which accompanies ſtill royal Blood) he looked cheerfully, and compoſed ſo his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that no body perceived his alteration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> no leſs ſubtile then he in concealing her Paſſions, at the coming of the Nurſe (to cauſe no admiration in her) diſarrayed her ſelf of that rigor with which ſhe was apparrel'd, while ſhe was with <hi>Antiochus</hi> alone, and began to diſcourſe now with him, now with her, with her uſual Sweetneſs and Courteſie.</p>
               <p>The Prince perceived thoſe Arts, and was very glad of them, hoping that the cruelty which his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180450:37"/>Queen had expreſſed to him, either proceeded from meer Capriciouſneſs, or was bred of a Deſire to make tryal of his Conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Being afterwards departed with her uſual Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, he employed himſelf in thinking, if by chance he had any ways deſerved the diſdain which his Queen ſhewed to him. His Sighs were many, his Compunctions great, and his Diſcourſes to himſelf not conciſe. But afterwards finding for many days together, that when <hi>Stratonica</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſhe ſtill kept her ſelf on her guard, but when they were in company, ſhe uſed the forementioned dexterity, the unfortunate Prince began to loſe all hope.</p>
               <p>His ſorrows become Gyants, ſo tyrannized over his minde, that he ſometimes was almoſt diſtracted. Knowing therefore the imminent danger not onely of his Life, but his Honor, he reſolved to provide for himſelf all the remedies which ſeemed to him the beſt to remove <hi>Stratonica</hi> from his Heart.</p>
               <p>He firſt of all therefore fell to reading certain Books of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> of the Contempt of the World, that by them, as by ſo many Counſellors (becauſe he was diffident to diſcover his paſſions to any) he might receive advertiſements and means to deſpiſe all terreſtrial affections, and uſe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, by help of which onely a man may make himſelf very happy on earth.</p>
               <p>His Minde being plunged in this kinde of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he conſidered oftentimes the Nature of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and how ſubject to frailty; why the intellect of man (that is of ſo noble and ſo ſublime a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:180450:38"/>ſhould abandon it ſelf in that maner, as to loſe the beſt operations of its faculty in tracing a Woman.</p>
               <p>Being encouraged many times with ſuch like thoughts, he fell (in <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s abſence) to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of her Qualities and Beauty; ſo fortifying himſelf in thoſe Speculations, that he thought he then had courage enough to oppoſe the power of her Preſence.</p>
               <p>But afterwards having occaſion of ſeeing her, in order to the accidents of the Day, the unfortunate Prince raviſht with beholding the Majeſty of that Face, and the lightning of thoſe Eyes, changing himſelf wholly in a moment, ſaid aloud to himſelf,</p>
               <p>Alas, who would not underſtand it for a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to loſe his life for one of thy looks? Who onely to ſee thee (deareſt ſoul) would not adventure all Fortune, and hazard all danger? O <hi>Antiochus!</hi> and haſt thou the heart to neglect her? haſt thou a minde that can form a thought that is not hers? ignorant man that thou art, and what torment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not an ingratitude like thine?</p>
               <p>His Soul (which within him dictated thoſe thoughts) made the Queen very fully underſtand his reſentments by the force of his looks. But ſhe (though ſhe pitied him) was more ſenſible of her own Honor. To that end neglecting all thoſe actions, which might ſeem to mollifie her towards her <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſhe ſought too to make her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable by Cuſtom, where ſhe had begun by Choice.</p>
               <p>The Prince by this maner diſconſolately living,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:180450:38"/>ſtudied how to cure the diſaſters of his minde (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides by the reading of Books) with much Playing and Hunting.</p>
               <p>It is hard to relate, how pleaſing he was to the company of the Courtiers, how lovely, and how much deſired. He played to loſe, becauſe all gain, but that of the favor of the Queen, would have been ingrateful to him. The greateſt pleaſure he had in thoſe paſtimes, was to ſigh. His friends ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he ſighed for his ill Fortune, and he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fighed for Love; the effects of his cruel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which while he was a Lover, made him thought avaricious.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in the middle of the thickeſt Woods, which <hi>Libanus</hi> backs, ſtraying from the company that followed him, and lighting at the foot of a Tree, to which he ty'd his horſe, he ſate on the graſs, and leaning his ſad head on the Trunk, which doubtleſs was ſofter then <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Heart, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cheeks with Tears, ſoon after he eccho'd forth Accents, which would have mov'd to pity the moſt pityleſs Tygers.</p>
               <p>One time then among the reſt, after he had wept a good while in thoſe uncouth ſolitudes, he was invaded by a thought, which ſaid thus unto him,</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe bewailſt ſo thy Fortune, and <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s Favor, if thou knowſt not by how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways Love compaſſes his ends? Who aſſures thee that <hi>Stratonica</hi> ſhews not her ſelf ſo rigid to thee, that by forcing thee to tell her what kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe hath ever received from thee, thou mayſt have the occaſion to engrave thy Love in her? and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:180450:39"/>why loſeſt ſo unprofitably thy time, and ſeekeſt the moſt ſolitary Woods to diſſolve thy ſelf with Weeping? O fooliſh, O careleſs man! Riſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf, take Courage, encounter the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>O ye Gods, which inhabit hereabouts, if there be any among you that hear my complaints, and pity my diſaſters, now ſhew your gentleneſs in proſpering my Deſires. Deny me not your help, O Sacred <hi>Napeae;</hi> ye happy <hi>Oreades</hi> infuſe boldneſs into this Heart, which onely is too Timerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe too Amorous. I go to end my Woes, or to begin them for ever.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce ſaid that, but leaping on his Horſe, he impatiently rode through thoſe leavy obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to finde out his attendance, and return with all ſpeed to the City, and diſcover himſelf to his Queen.</p>
               <p>And behold, turning by the corner of a High and Precipitious heap of Stones, which made as it were the Frontiſpiece of a Landskip-work at the foot of a great Mountain, he ſaw in the midſt of ſome buſhes a Bear fly ſlowly away. <hi>Antiochus</hi> follows him, and when he came near him, ſaw by his hair that was bloody, that he's hurt. He ſtraightways throws at him a Dart, which he had in his hand, with great force, and wounds him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the neck: The Bear groans and roars in that maner, that the eccho's thereabouts of thoſe ſilent Deſerts repeat them. His roaring was a kinde of wilde Trumpet, which called from a Grot a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear of that infinite greatneſs, that ſhe ſeemed a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mountain.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:180450:39"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> had an occaſion to ſhew there, that his ſword could wound as well as his heart was wounded. He employed all the valor he had, for the two enemies before him omitted no means with their Tusks and their Paws to rob him of his life; but Sweating and Panting often hard for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he at laſt overcame them.</p>
               <p>The two Beaſts lying proſtrate on the Earth, were a horrible Spectacle to the Eyes of all the Court, which preſently came together in defence of their Lord.</p>
               <p>The She-bear was there known by many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people for the terror of thoſe Woods, and the ſcourge of thoſe Countreys. They related many murthers done by her, they recounted many ſlaughters of herds of Cattel. Every one bleſſed the wounding Hand, and curſed a thouſand times the unlucky Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The bravery of <hi>Antiochus</hi> was ſpoken of by all, and inſerted in their hearts a wonderful reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>He commanding a freſh Horſe to be brought him (after he had ordered ſome horſe-loads of his game to be carried along) ſet on towards <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sighs were the Heralds of his coming, and Fears the companions of his journey. The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince rode perpending, if by Fortune his Queen were to be appeaſed by the Preſent of thoſe Beaſts. He ſtudied what means would be the fitteſt to preſent them unto her.</p>
               <p>O Gods! What does not an enamored Heart ruminate?</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:180450:40"/>
               <p>When he arrived at the City, the Diſcourſes were great about the danger and the prey. The King embracing his Son, praiſed him modeſtly, and heard with much pleaſure of the Lords that were with him, the Courage and Bravery he had ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Great Actions have more luſtre in yong men then old. To be greater in Age, is to be leſs in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, for a great Age obliges to grave Things. Youth is ſo Beautiful, that even the Actions it does, learn of it beautiful Qualities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> being come to behold <hi>Antiochus</hi> his game, ſhewed very much joy in commending him highly, and was glad on his behalf, that he had without harm eſcaped ſuch a danger. Her ſerene Countenance, and ſweet Preſence, had the power to deceive a ſecond time the unfortunate Prince. He (when he had preſented her with the prey, and paſſed ſome fine Complements with her) had no opportunity of finding her alone by himſelf, to aſſure himſelf if truly ſhe had left her firſt rigor.</p>
               <p>But when he had a time very fit for this tryal, the Queen ſhewed her ſelf to him very ſevere and reſerved, as if that ſhe had not been the Woman that had courted him before in that maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> would have ſpoken, and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution his deſign determined in the Wood, but had not the courage to do it. He knew very well the cruelty of his Fate, and had not the power to defend himſelf from it with any thing but ſilence.</p>
               <p>Lovers reſolutions are Miſts; They condenſe in the abſence of the party beloved, but vaniſh at her preſence, as at the Suns rayes. The will of a Lover,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180450:40"/>like one that is bound, may move, but not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine actions.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate Youth departed from his Miſtreſs in that maner, as if his departure had been liker a flight, then a going away. He wept not, he no longer bewailed his ill fortune; his grief was ſo great, that it found no more tears nor words.</p>
               <p>Now he took a pleaſure in being deſperate, for onely in deſpair he had placed all his hopes. He deſired to die; and the ſooner to die, he ſtudied how he might leave the Court. He feared that a look of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> would one day or other, by aſſwaging his torments, make them longer-lived. Theſe things deſigned in his minde, made him ſeem pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the eyes of his acquaintance. His conceits and witty mirth in Converſation, forſook him, and every day they ſaw him more ſolitary and retired.</p>
               <p>Melancholly now encamping it ſelf in his Face, painted in his Eyes a Lead-colour, and a paleneſs in his Cheeks. He no longer lifted up his ſight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his cruel Miſtreſs, for Nature had taught him not to look on what had killed him. Having loſt the pleaſure of Eating, and the caſe of Sleep, Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a horrible extenuation began to conſume all his Fleſh. Onely broken ſighs were heard to come from him, which reſembling Musket-noiſes, informed them with a ſmall report, that Death now made a breach in the Rock of his Heart.</p>
               <p>Theſe Mutations being noted by the Court, gave matter to various Diſcourſes and Whiſperings. Every one pitied the diſaſters of that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who not onely for being their Prince, but for being
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:180450:41"/>ſo good and ſo juſt, to the vaſſallages of their Bodies, had the power to joyn that of their Mindes.</p>
               <p>They attributed to ſeveral Cauſes, the Effect of this his Indiſpoſition. Some ſaid it proceeded from wearineſs and diſorder, cauſed by Hunting; others affirmed, that it grew of ſome ſecret Witchcraft: This ſwore it came from his own Saturnine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and Melancholly, which in the flower of Youth uſes to turn to a hectique Feaver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who faw in his ſad Face, the Effects of an unknown diſeaſe to encreaſe every day, could do no leſs but bewail with the Tears of Affection more then Maternal, the loſt Health of ſo dear a Son-in-law. Though ſhe (as obliged by the Laws of Honeſty) appeared externally rigorous, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally loved her deareſt Prince more then her ſelf.</p>
               <p>And how could ſhe ever hate him, who had not offended her in any thing, but in ſerving her too much. The amorous Queen remembred point by point all the Favors which the courteous Youth had ever done her.</p>
               <p>O barking Remembrances (ſhe ſaid) ye truly upbraid my Ingratitudes to me with an eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach! But alas, what ſhould I do? Heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me to love him as a Lover; my Honor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it. I would do it howſoever, but what avails it me, if when I have done it, he hath not returned my Love? What can I expect from one who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not with me? Ye ſee well, O Heavens, if I have not given him occaſions, with what prejudice too to my decorum.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:180450:41"/>
               <p>So <hi>Stratonica</hi> ſpake to her ſelf, and bewailed her ſelf. But <hi>Seleucus</hi> above all as a Father (to whom the Intereſt of an only Son imported the whole ſum of his happineſs) was afflicted in that maner, that little leſs then <hi>Antiochus</hi> he was pitied of the Court.</p>
               <p>The good King was diſtracted in thinking what it was that could ever have reduced to that ſtate his dear Son. He conſulted his wiſeſt Counſellors, he asked <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s opinion, and above all he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with all diligence of the Troop of Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques which attended his Perſon, if by chance the yong Youth had committed any diſorder, of which might be bred this indiſpoſition. He would not ask him himſelf of it, for fear of diſpleaſing him. He onely asked him what he had a minde to.</p>
               <p>Every thing (my Son) is obedient to thy beck, ſo that thou be merry, ſo that thou tell me if any thing diſcontents thee, wherein I may give thee conſolation; this Scepter can have no greater Glory, then to be employed for thee. And of what uſe would this Scepter be to me without thee? Alas, it can do me no pleaſure, unleſs it be ſupported by thy right hand. All my hopes hang on the thrid of thy life; Have then a care of thy ſelf, O deareſt <hi>Antiochus!</hi> Thou ſeeſt that at the very ſame time thou haſt a care of me too.</p>
               <p>So ſpake the diſconſolate <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and could hardly forbear weeping.</p>
               <p>The Prince, who long had deſired occaſion to beg leave of his Father to depart from the Court, having the opportunity to effect his deſire, returned this anſwer:</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:180450:42"/>
               <p>Sir, What it is that I feel, I know not. I know very well that I am not the cauſe of this my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes Effect. No diſcontent afflicts me, but that which proceeds from your Majeſties Affliction. My indiſpoſition I hope will not encreaſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the change of Air would do me much good, if your Majeſty were ſo pleaſed. I am of opinion, that the Air of <hi>Laodicea</hi> would help me very much, as well for the beauty of the Scituation, as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity I have to ſee a City built after your minde, of which I hear wonders. But I would not have with me there the Court; My pleaſure would be to go thither onely with thoſe Lords which would pleaſe moſt your Majeſty.</p>
               <p>I am moſt willing (replyed <hi>Seleucus</hi>) to let thee go to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and I will ſend thee with that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that is fit for thy Perſon. But why (deareſt Son) art unwilling to have me go with thee? Who better then I can have a care of thy eaſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for thy neceſſities? And why wouldſt thou at any time deſire me to ſuffer by ſtaying far from thee when thou art ſick? I will come then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and my coming ſhall not diſpleaſe thee.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Antiochus</hi> replying (that he requeſted him to let him go alone, and that there was no ſuch danger in his ſickneſs, that required the Perſon of his Majeſty; and that if he went, he would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently draw after him all the diſpatches and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, ſo that in ſtead of enjoying a calm tranquillity, he ſhould be ſubject to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of that concourſe of People which always the Court carries with it) ſo prevailed, that the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180450:42"/>King was ſomewhat ſatisfied, and ſaid he would conſider a little of this reſolution, and do afterwards what he ſhould be adviſed to for the beſt.</p>
               <p>So they continued, and <hi>Seleucus</hi> fell preſently to ordering thoſe things which ſeemed to him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not onely for the conveniency, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of a voyage, and his abode in the City.</p>
               <p>He firſt of all ordained ſo ample and numerous a Court, that it envyed not the greateſt Eaſtern Kings. He allowed the Prince Gentlemen, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers and Counſellors. He declared him ſupream Governor of the Province and City of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> He ſent Letters to <hi>Doride,</hi> a Caſtle ſeated on the bank of the River <hi>Licus,</hi> That they ſhould have in readineſs with all ſpeed five and twenty convenient ſhips, for from thence to <hi>Laodicea</hi> they were to ſail on the ſaid River. He then ſelected forty men famous in all Profeſſions to give him entertainment, and cauſe him to ſpend vertuouſly his time. He gave him <hi>Hermogenes</hi> and <hi>Carneades</hi> the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of the Kingdom, to the end that they ſhould be continually aſſiſtant to his Perſon; and laſtly he made him a ſtately and an abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Moveables and Moneys.</p>
               <p>He then frequently conſulted the chiefeſt of the Court, if he ſhould let <hi>Antiochus</hi> go alone, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompany him and aſſiſt him. It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that ſince <hi>Antiochus</hi> deſired to go alone, his deſire ſhould not be croſt, leſt his ſickneſs ſhould grow worſe. That therefore two Poſts ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be kept going to give the leaſt notice of his health.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:180450:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the mean time (like one that is condemned to dye) when he heard any noyſe in order to his journey, felt his blood freize, and his Vital ſtrength fail him. He would have departed alone with his Fancy, and willingly have ſtaid with his Body to adore Her that hated Him.</p>
               <p>Theſe deſires paſſed through his minde, but made no ſtay there. As ſoon as he perceived them, he did a thouſand contrary actions, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the very ſame deſire, reduced it to deſire his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture with violence.</p>
               <p>O Tumults, ſo much the fiercer and more to be deplored, by how much they are heard to make a noyſe in the Republick of the Heart! So it comes to paſs, that he makes a War with his Senſes to tame them, who becauſe he hath been too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to them, comes to loſe the dominion he had over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> looked ſometimes in the glaſs, not to court his Face, but to ſee in his Countenance, as it were in a living Dyal, what Figure the hours of his Life were ſtill at.</p>
               <p>To ſee buried his lively Looks in the double grave of his concenter'd Eyes, and perceive in the barrenneſs of the mountainous place of his meager Jaws the freſhneſs of his Cheeks, cauſed (it cannot be denied) in the unfortunate Lover thoſe Motives of ſorrow which Nature cannot chooſe but be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, when ſhe ſees her ſelf decay by little and little. But drawing from the centre of weakneſs that force, which is the inſeperable companion of a generous Minde, he joyfully ſmiled at the ſight
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180450:43"/>of his miſerable Image, comforting himſelf not a little, that from the yellow colour of his face, he argued that his Death began to vary.</p>
               <p>The Phyſicians haſtned his departure to change Air, for they every day ſaw him irrecoverably grow worſe. He himſelf (becauſe he knew he went to die, and deſirous to die as ſoon as he could) ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the neceſſary things, though he could ſcarce ſtand on his Legs.</p>
               <p>At laſt the day before that of his journey being come, he was not wanting to diſquiet himſelf at the riſing of the Sun, which enlightned (to ſpeak ſo) the vigil of his death.</p>
               <p>He made himſelf remember, how that Light was the laſt which he ſhould ever ſee under his Fathers roof. And as one who was ſenſible in his Heart that he was dying, he called all the Family to him, which ſerved him in the Court, to every one of whom (as it were in the nature of a Will) he began to bequeath Moneys and give Rewards.</p>
               <p>Both Sexes wept bitterly with a melting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to ſee with what love their afflicted Prince, by diſpencing his gifts, took his leave of them.</p>
               <p>That day all the Court was as ſad, as if one of the greateſt of the Kingdom had been dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus,</hi> the poor King (although it miſ-became his royal Grace) could not forbear weeping in that common Affliction.</p>
               <p>The Cup of an Eye is too narrow a Veſſel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Tears which the grief for a Son does afford.</p>
               <p>His Phyſicians and Friends were not wanting to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:180450:44"/>comfort him, and perſwade him to the hopes of his recovery and welfare; but he either reſolved not to give credit to their Promiſes, or had not the patience to expect the Fruits of them.</p>
               <p>Now the amorous Prince had ſpent all the day in taking his leave of his Friends, and the Ladies. He was onely to be diſmiſſed by his Father, and his fair cruel Mother. But knowing that both the one and other would accompany him the day following a little way out of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he retired into his Lodgings no leſs weary of what he had done, then dejected with melancholly.</p>
               <p>There the unfortunate Prince recollecting well himſelf, fell a thinking in what a ſad condition he was; and when he had been a good while immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he brake out ſighing:</p>
               <p>Go to poor <hi>Antiochus,</hi> this is the laſt Evening; Be thankful to the Gods for all the favors they have done thee. The continuation of thy life hath been an effect of their Clemency, not the fruit of thy Merit. Be glad that thou art born a Prince, that thou haſt been the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his Crown, Heaven had made thee onely. Rejoyce that thou haſt lived in <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s time, that ſhe hath been thy Mother, that thou haſt ſerved her as a Miſtreſs; ſuch happineſſes could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in any ſuppoſed mortal. It is no wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thou art dying ſo opportunely. Thou dieſt beloved of all but <hi>Stratonica;</hi> and thou dieſt innocent, unleſs for the offence committed againſt thy Father. Howſoever it is no little Conſolation to a pious Son, to purge with death a fault done
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:180450:44"/>onely in Thought. Go to Walls, farewel; farewel paternal Roofs, I ſhall never more ſee you again.</p>
               <p>When he had ſaid ſo, feeling his Eyes fill with tears, to deprive himſelf likewiſe of the comfort which weeping might afford him, he took a Harp into his hands, on whoſe ſtrings (ſinging ſo often with <hi>Stratonica</hi>) he had woven the Net for his own dear Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Strings ſounded ſo ſadly at the touch of his Fingers, that it ſeemed (they mourning too) were deſirous to ſing the Obſequies of their Princes dead Felicities.</p>
               <p>Even in thoſe dry Nerves of the reſounding Wood, <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Diſaſters had the power to infuſe a mourning Quality.</p>
               <p>When he ſaw he no longer was able to ſtruggle with Nature, he looked up towards Heaven, and with an Action, even comely in Sorrow, let fall ſome tears ſo great and heavy, that it ſeemed they came from a Countrey where Grief was in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Thence allured with the pleaſure that is found in weeping, he fell to ſinging in this maner:
<q>
                     <l>POur out, pour out ſad Eyes your tears</l>
                     <l>By hundreds, and by thouſands too,</l>
                     <l>To the laſt torments all th' arrears</l>
                     <l>Of every drop of Sorrow's due.</l>
                     <l>Now ſince the haughty ſparks of Fire</l>
                     <l>Muſt cover'd with the Aſhes be</l>
                     <l>Of Death; Eyes ere ye have deſire</l>
                     <l>To die, and hence depart, firſt ſee</l>
                     <l>That ye at laſt your old courſe take,</l>
                     <l>And of your ſelves two Rivers make.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:180450:45"/>
               <p>When he had ended his Song, and recovered his Bed, he was invaded in the night by a gentle Feaver. Behold unhappy <hi>Antiochus</hi> the beginning of thy death. The Phyſicians which thought in the Morning to cauſe him to be gone, finding him ſo altered, changed preſently opinion, and informing the King of it, his departure was deferred till a better opportunity.</p>

As many ſtrokes of his Pulſe as he obſerved to reverberate on his Arm, ſo many advices he ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the ruine of his own <hi>individuum.</hi> The wretched Prince remembered not himſelf to be Feaveriſh without Joy, becauſe his Miſeries were at that paſs, as they made even his Feaver ſeem a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to him. <hi>Seleucus</hi> therefore ſeeing the dangers to encreaſe, and the hopes of his Sons health to fail him, found no courage in his Breaſt to manage the reſentments he had of them.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate King ſate like an aged <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to bewail in the dark corner of a Chamber the Miſeries of humane Mutability. His tears were witneſſes of that Sorrow, which made an Artificer in his Minde, cauſed him to ſee a Crown turned into a Coffin. Poor <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and who would not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:180450:46"/>have pitied the Tears in the Eyes of a King, while he mourned for the greateſt occaſion that can be mourned for.</p>
               <p>Tears miſ-become the face of a man, for they being the ſweat of the Heart, a man ſhould not ſeem to have ſo ſoft a Heart, that can thaw it ſelf into Water. But if ever we may weep, we can never weep better then for that life's loſs, on whoſe being depends the Command of a Kingdom. It is a ſweet thing to live, and by living to reign.</p>
               <p>The Grief of the Courtiers receiving its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from Diſaſters of that kinde, many of them ſeemed ſo concerned in the King his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that affecting a Sorrow in their Faces, they forced themſelves in a maner to vanquiſh <hi>Seleucus</hi> in Tears.</p>
               <p>It is truly deplorable in a Prince, to ſee that in a time of his Adverſity, he hath not a Countenance about him, with whoſe ſerenity he may chear up in ſome ſort his own Sadneſs. It ſeems fatal in a kinde for all to ſeem feignedly ſad, becauſe that adulation which makes him proud in Joy, increaſes his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he is in Affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who had by <hi>Licofronia</hi>'s perſwaſions (ſo frequently as aforeſaid retreating from Love) been cruel to her <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when ſhe ſaw him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on a Bed, and languiſhing among the flames of a gentle Feaver, thought her ſelf moſt ſurely the Murtherer of her Dear. Thence often repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf, that ſhe had with too much Obedience obſerved the Precepts of a barbarous old Woman, curſing her own Credulity, and the others Severity,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:180450:46"/>ſhe bewailed with Tears ſurpaſſing Bitterneſs, the diſguſts ſhe had cauſed to her Prince, and ſwore to her ſelf to omit no occaſion, whereby ſhe might aſſure him of her Love, which miſſed of its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But ſeeing that the Sorrow which had not joyned to it ſome means of aſſiſtance, was too bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it ſelf, and too unprofitable to the ſick Prince, forbearing her Tears, ſhe fell with a courage derived from <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to ſeeking of Comforts for her Husband, and finding out Remedies for her Son-in-law. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the ſweet words, the lovely Countenance, and compaſſionate Looks, with which I imagine to my ſelf ſhe ſought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>Seleucus</hi> at that time: Fortunate King, to whoſe Conſolations were deſigned the fineſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the Loves of a <hi>Stratonica</hi> had the power to inſtil. How much envied would he have been, if at a leſs rate then <hi>Antiochus</hi> his ſickneſs, he could have bought the pity of ſo beautiful a Queen?</p>
               <p>The Phyſicians called together to a Conſult, their Opinions were as various as their Diſcourſes. Their difference in the knowledge of the Quality, made infinitely increaſe the quantity of Cauſes, to which they did attribute the diſeaſe of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Every one of them ſtudied to overcome his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in Opinion, becauſe by this means he hoped to overcome him in Eſſence; but they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that on the Being of the Phyſician, the Prince his not Being depended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> and her Husband aſſiſted at this kinde of inquiry, not as Kings, but guilty Perſons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:180450:47"/>for their love to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> they might ſay they aſſiſted at the tryal of their lives. And indeed, as guilty, they grew pale at every ſaying, and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every motion of that Colledge, which (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a criminal Wheel) was come to that paſs, to have even Authority over the life of the Prince.</p>
               <p>No man more participates of extreams then a Phyſician; He (if we may ſpeak like a meer Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher) is a God or a Devil. If he cures with Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and makes well, the World is not able to reward him; if he kills temerariouſly, it cannot enough puniſh him. When he gives an aſſurance of Life, every one cryes up his Fame; when he happens to kill, even the Earth hides his faults. He can never want Happineſs, for either as Vertuous he's exalted, or as Vicious not ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>After long debates, <hi>Hermogenes</hi> and <hi>Carneades</hi> diſſenting the one from the other, diſputed it fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This would have <hi>Antiochus</hi> to be ſick of a Hectique Feaver, that to be Bewitched.</p>
               <p>This diſcord of the Phyſicians being divulged through <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> gave matter of Diſcourſe to the Idle, and of Revenge to the Malicious.</p>
               <p>The Reader may imagine what health that muſt be, poor <hi>Seleucus</hi> hoped for to the Prince his diſeaſe, while by the Phyſicians uncertain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he foreſaw the ſick Princes certain death. His condition ſeemed the more deplorable, by how much being forced to endure his Sons Murther, he was to approve of his intention that killed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> in the mean time, watching like an <hi>Argos</hi> how to comfort her beloved ſick Prince,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180450:47"/>counſelled the King to have him removed to a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace without the City called <hi>Elyſium.</hi> She (though ſhe did not fully comprehend the quality of his ſickneſs) perceived that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was mortally Melancholly, and that therefore that Pallaces ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation could not chooſe but give great eaſe to his ſorrows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elyſium</hi> is a Place, which now humbling it ſelf in fallowed Plains, now proud in well husbanded Hills, marries barren Woods to cultivated Villa's, and joyns neat Gardens to elaborated Fountains. There, as in a Fraſcati at <hi>Rome,</hi> or a Sampierdare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na at <hi>Genoa,</hi> the greateſt Rulers of <hi>Soria</hi> dwelling in the Country in the Summer, Pallaces are ſeen, which reſembling the talleſt ſons of Architecture, with their Gyant-like Roofs wage an innocent war with the Stars, and cauſing Admiration to tumble down headlong from the height of their Fabricks, make dreadful in a maner their Beauty.</p>
               <p>Nature, that hath conſtituted an Air to this place where the Spring is perpetual, ſeems that with reaſon ſhe will always have that ſoyl enamell'd with flowers, which is deſtined for the Garden of the world. Now there on a hill covered with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt verdure that can be repreſented in any Dutch Tapiſtry, the Kings houſe was built.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe a Pallace is to petrifie a Pen. Let it therefore ſuffice to ſay of it, That Nature hath not hardned any Marble, nor refined Jewels, nor bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Gold, but for this houſe's Structure. The Pillars ſeem onely to be made to cauſe Admiration, the open Galleries to aſſemble Magnificence, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:180450:48"/>the Statues to civilize the Stones. The Halls eccho for their vaſtneſs, the Chambers gliſter with Riches, the Cabinets are proud of the Ornaments they have, and every thing in fine is Majeſtick, every thing infuſes a reverence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> being removed to this Place, the King delayed not to come thither with all the Court. There was a Gentleman lately arrived in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who boaſted of <hi>Cyprus</hi> for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and was called <hi>Climenes.</hi> He, verſed in many Tongues, and experienced in the Cuſtoms of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, ſeemed to have travelled a great part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and to have ſeen the Courts of all the greateſt Princes then living. Whereupon being infinitely capable of any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was valued by all for a man of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Parts, and invincible dexterity in the affairs of the World. But as Nature had enrich'd him with the gifts of the Minde, ſo ſhe had made him very inconſiderable in the qualities of the Body. For being Squint-ey'd, Toothleſs, and Flat-nos'd, he would doubtleſs have offended the eyes of all that beheld him, if the garb of a ſtrong and well proportioned Stature, and the cheerfulneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of a Noble deportment, had not almoſt quite concealed in him the Deformity of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>But he having brought ſome Letters to <hi>Licofro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> from her onely Son <hi>Alceſtes,</hi> for whoſe abſence the poor Matron lived diſconſolately, began on that account to inſinuate himſelf into the favor of the greateſt at Court; and being extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180450:48"/>by <hi>Licofronia,</hi> who profeſſed her ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much obliged to him, he came ſo to be maſter of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his affection, that he being greatly taken with this Gentlemans converſation, admitted none but him into the moſt intrinſecal and freeſt familiarity in his Chamber. The Prince therefore one day much deſiring to hear of ſome diſaſter in anothers affections, to ſee if the torments of others were comparable to, or ſurpaſſed his torments, ſpake to <hi>Climenes</hi> to relate ſomething to him, in order to his love; for as much as that he being (for ought he could ſee) placed under a great, but not altogether fortunate condition, he imagined that his adventures could not without wonder be heard, nor pitied without pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes,</hi> who encountered with all earneſtneſs the deſires of the Prince, to faſten the ſurer himſelf in his Favor, returned him this anſwer, That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not to obey him in this, as he had always done in every thing elſe; he onely conſidered, that the accidents of his love (although they exceeded the limits of an ordinary Fortune) were not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to deſerve a Princes hearing. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Relation which his Highneſs ſuppoſed might occaſion him half an hours paſtime, would doubtleſs prove to him a day of vexation. But <hi>Antiochus</hi> renewing his inſtance, made <hi>Climenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in this maner:</p>
               <p>Since your Highneſs will have me relate the greateſt torment that ever I have ſuffered for Love, you muſt know, that ſcarce I had entered into the fourth luſtre of my Age, but a malignant Feaver (I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180450:49"/>know not by what means) having ſeized upon me, had almoſt epitomized my life in a ſigh. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who onely in me numbered all his Progeny) being inſeperable from thoſe Feathers, of which he thought my breath could make it ſelf Wings to fly to the other World, made his ſorrow the more to be pitied, by how much my diſeaſe was eſteemed the more dangerous.</p>
               <p>But the flame now burning within all my bowels, had ſo dried up my Palate, that my Tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived too of that little humidity which makes it fit for motion, was not onely unable to ſpeak, but inflexible likewiſe. I was more oppreſſed with Thirſt then the Feaver; and my Fortune to make me ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently unhappy, when it had painted in my Fancy all the cool Waters that I had ever ſeen to guſh out of the earth, offered me to drink in the Cup of two weeping Eyes, the Tears which my old Father ſhed.</p>
               <p>While I burned in this maner (the hopes of my health being abandoned before by the Phyſicians) a Matron, called <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> who dwelt near our houſe, ſhewed ſuch skill in preparing me a Potion, that (my Thirſt and Feaver being drowned in that draught) I found my ſelf wholly recovered. This Favor (then which there could be none greater done to me) ſo obliged me to <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> that to viſit her almoſt every day, and ſerve her in all her occaſions, ſeemed to me very ſlender demonſtrations of that Love which I owed her. But alas, many days had not paſſed, but I perceived that the drink which had plainly refreſhed my body, had with all burnt ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my heart.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:180450:49"/>
               <p>I felt by little and little a Thought riſing in my Minde, which continually repreſented to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the reſemblance of this Lady, who was not very handſom; and joyned to the Thought I found grown a Deſire, which forced me to ſpend the greateſt part of my time in her fruitleſs Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I could not elſe endure. This Lady was a Widow, who beſides her Riches and noble Birth, had an excellent Wit, which had dedicated her to the Science of Phyſick and Magick from her Childhood. She therefore accuſtomed to phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Humors, ſurmounting her Sex, and well pleaſed with my Shape, was very much enamored of me. And encountering an occaſion by that my diſeaſe, to introduce into my Bowels with ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext, the tyranny of her Deſires, ſhe raiſed in the Calm of that Potion a boiſterous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt to my life. I had not long been well, but a Son of hers died, called <hi>Sylvio;</hi> to the Tears of whoſe Funeral, the eyes of her Siſter, named <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> came running.</p>
               <p>I, who had often heard commended this Maid for a very great Beauty, in whom Nature had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled her utmoſt Ability, deſired much to ſee her. But becauſe it is a cuſtom among the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to appear in no Company but their Friends, my Curioſity was unſatisfied till ſhe came to behold the dead Body of dear <hi>Sylvio.</hi> Who is able to relate what a wound that weeping Beauty then made in my Heart? Perhaps it was the pity of Love to bring it ſo about, that the firſt time I contemplated thoſe Eyes, I ſhould contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:180450:50"/>them weeping. What would not that fire have cauſed in me, if as it was diminiſhed by the moiſture of her Tears, it had been augmented by the rayes of her Smiling? Her Hair being ſpread on the bewailed Body, ſhewed either that ſhe had ſet at liberty the Souls ſhe had tyed there, to the end they ſhould run to revive him, or had offered up a treaſure to Death, to the end it ſhould not be any hinderance to his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But what need is there of this relation? Even the mourning attire which ſhe had on her fair ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Limbs, concurred in declaring <hi>Gloricia</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Queen.</p>
               <p>I on the one ſide finding my ſelf naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to love <hi>Gloricia,</hi> on the other knowing I was forced by a ſupernatural Power to wait on <hi>Mirte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> was the moſt afflicted, and moſt troubled man in the World. Having therefore one day choſen a fit opportunity, I ſaid to <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> That I knew very well, how ſhe had by her Charms made me a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to her, to whom my Obligations, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors ſhe had firſt of all done me, diſpoſed me; that it therefore ſeemed needleſs to me for her to make uſe of Compulſion, where my Will ſo many ways concurred without Artifice. And that if Loves true Happineſs conſiſted in nothing but a natural Sympathy, how could ſhe ever be ſure to enjoy my Affection, if ſhe could not come to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I freely complied with her, or by force? Theſe Reaſons, together with thoſe Prayers which every one knows how powerful they are in his Mouth who pretends to be a Lover, ſo wrought in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:180450:50"/>Minde of <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> that ſhe was content to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage me from her Charms, and entreated me to promiſe her, to be wholly hers willingly. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her, That I uſed not by way of an Oath to binde my Will, howſoever that ſhe might be aſſured, that I would not be ingrateful for the Love which ſhe bare me.</p>
               <p>Being freed in this maner from her Bonds, many days had not paſſed, but I conſecrated wholly my ſelf to the love of <hi>Gloricia,</hi> and preſently after had the means to diſcover my ſelf to be a Lover. She who had a very good Opinion of me, expected not that I ſhould be laviſh in beſeeching her Favor, but granted it me at my firſt entreaty, and ſwore unto me a reciprocal good Will. <hi>Mirtenia</hi> was aware of our Love, inſomuch, that being deſperately jealous of what I had done, ſhe endeavored by all poſſible means to allure me to her Love, and divert me from her Siſters.</p>
               <p>This Gentlewoman was Lady of a Countrey called <hi>Feacide,</hi> in which there is a Mountain of Wonders. This dreadful for its Nature and Form, aſcends (all Spungy with Rocks) ſo high towards Heaven, that the Eye being weary of ſo ſteepy an Aſcent, abandons it often before it arrives at the top. There the horrors of Winter (as it were in their own Neſt) perpetually hatching Snow, Arm with ſharp Ice gaſping Rocks, and cloathing (to ſpeak ſo) their backs with white Weapons, with their ſtony points defie the Airs ſharpneſs. Nothing elſe is to be ſeen on all the Mountain, but cruſty rugged Stones, clear Stones, and precipices of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180450:51"/>Rocks, among which grow thin and ſcattered ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Fir-trees. Rivelets of Water run tumbling down from the ſnowy Summit, which foaming among the Stones by their Fraction, ſeem afar off to be ſo many Silver Selvages, which with barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Pomp are deſirous to beautifie the rugged Mountain; at the foot of which a troubled River running, enters into a narrow paſſage, which runs afterwards emptying it ſelf into a woody Plain. The noiſe of the Wind that lies in this Straight, together with the roaring of the Water, which breaks among the Caverns of the Channel, ſo fill every Heart with aſtoniſhment, that they make this place thought the habitation of Hell. Thither I was brought by <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> under pretence to go viſit her Lands. When we were come to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and had left the Servants we had there at the mouth of a craggy Grot, onely ſhe and I went paſſing through the Straights of the Cave, into the Court of an enchanted Pallace, where I ſaw incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things. When ſhe there had refreſhed me with Dainties, and moſt excellent Muſick, ſhe ſhewed me in a Room adorned all with Pictures, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of my Progeny, who being to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted (as ſhe did aſſure me) from <hi>Cyprus</hi> into the City of <hi>Giano,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Liguria,</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that I ſhould entertain my ſelf a while in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>Heroes</hi> of that Nation, among whom I remember ſhe commended one much, who was to be the famouſeſt Warrier that ever ſhould be ſeen; and he had theſe Letters engraven at his feet, <hi>The Marqueſs</hi> AMBROSE SPINOLA. More below
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:180450:51"/>among men of a different Condition, though known well by Fame, ſhe cauſed me to write in a little Book, the names of three Poets and three Painters, ſome of which ſhe ſaid would be very great Lovers of one of my Lineage. The Poets were called <hi>Ceba, Chiabreta</hi> and <hi>Cavallo:</hi> The Painters <hi>Paggi, Borzone</hi> and <hi>Sarzana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things, which I thought the greateſt Wonders that ever could be ſeen in the World, ſo obliged me to the love of <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> that albeit naturally I found not my ſelf inclined to affect her, yet forgetting now <hi>Gloricia,</hi> I was willing to diſpoſe my ſelf openly to love her. She, who by mine Eyes, and my Countenance, began to perceive my good liking of her, continuing her kindneſſes to me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me into another Room, where the Pictures of all the handſomeſt Women (that had been or were to be in the World) were expoſed to view. Among them by chance turning my eye, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Ladies Picture, who was and ſhall be the firſt and laſt flame of my Heart, whoſe Eyes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were painted) being faſtned on mine, I thought ſaid to me, Behold me, O <hi>Climenes,</hi> thou knoweſt in what maner I was killed, and I know how much my Death hath been pitied by thee. Be confident, That albeit I am in the other World, I will not fail to love thee, as long as I ſhall have my Being.</p>
               <p>How ſenſleſs I was at the Senſe of thoſe words, your Highneſs may imagine. My Heart had not a Vein, which converting it ſelf into a River of Tears, ran not emptying it ſelf at the Flood-gate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:180450:52"/>of thoſe Eyes. <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> who ſaw me on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den become all a Deluge, being unable to penetrate the cauſe of ſo ſtrange a Sorrow, anxiouſly asked me, What Accident had the power to alter me in that maner. But the frequent Sobs not permitting me to ſpeak a whole word, I informed her as well as I could, That I deſired to go out of that Room as ſoon as was poſſible, and out of the whole Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace likewiſe. I had ſcarce ſaid that, but I was I know not how at the mouth of the Cave where we had left the Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mirtenia</hi> there asking me again, very earneſtly, of the cauſe of my Weeping, I anſwered her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this was a Diſaſter, which uſed to befal me, ſince I had had a very great Misfortune at the time my Mother died.</p>
               <p>She falling to comfort me as well as ſhe poſſibly could, endeavored to make me merry, and drew all her Lines to this Centre to gain my Affection. I who had engraven in the ſenſibleſt part of my Heart, the Looks of that Picture, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to my memory the Being of my Miſtreſs, the more I ſaw my ſelf made much of by <hi>Mirtenia,</hi> the more loathed her Love. Whereupon ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my Ingratitude, when we were returned to the City, and being perſwaded that all did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from my Love to <hi>Gloricia,</hi> bewitched her to Death, then killed my Father, and confined me to the ſtraights of a Bed, where I endured ſuch diſeaſes both in Minde and Body, that it was an Exceſs of Heavens Miracles to preſerve me alive.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:180450:52"/>
               <p>At laſt when <hi>Mirtenia</hi> had ſeen, that I could by no means be induced to love her, ſhe ſickning of Madneſs, died deſperately ſoon after: So after many Troubles and many Moneths being recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my diſeaſe, hating that Climate under whoſe Influences ſo many Diſaſters had befaln me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and when I long had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through ſeveral Kingdoms, I came laſtly to this Court.</p>
               <p>This Relation was a Lecture to the Prince of the Calamities of this World. He repondering to what Miſeries his Condition was ſubject, whoſe Ruines were deſigned by Fortune and Love, bewailed his own Diſaſters in the Misfortunes of <hi>Climenes.</hi> And when he had expreſſed the Conſolation he had felt by knowing ſome ſucceſs of his Life: Since (he ſaid to himſelf) we muſt live, if Life be an hoſtage, why truſt we Fortune with it, to give her aſſurance of all that which her Cruelties will have? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was reſolved to die, to free my ſelf from the Torments of a deſperate Love: Now I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to live, to be quit of the Troubles of a pitileſs Fortune. Lets die, O <hi>Antiochus!</hi> what can at all adventures be hoped for of a Womans Inconſtancies? And if the flames of a gentle Feaver, and the weakneſs of a long Extenuation, are unable to kill us, let us adde a forbearance of Meat.</p>
               <p>So ſpake <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and ſo cunningly he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf to perform his Reſolutions, that hiding his determined Faſt under the pretext of having no Appetite, he ſeemed to be pleaſed with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180450:53"/>nothing, becauſe he would not be conſtrained to eat any thing.</p>
               <p>It was then the Moneth of <hi>January</hi> masked like <hi>April;</hi> whereupon all the Lords of the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pallaces, being perſwaded no leſs by the Beauty of the Seaſon then <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s commands, came to dwell in <hi>Elyſium.</hi> The Court and Converſation being multiplyed by that means, the Nobility ſtudied nothing elſe, but the inventing of ways to recreate the Prince. Every one ſuppoſed that ſome ſudden Paſtime would more vigorouſly awake in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his lull'd-aſleep Mirth; and that a Ball, which owed its beginning to nothing but Harmony, might mitigate with its Motions, a diſeaſed Hearts Sorrows. But yet this Reſolution was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but it came to the Ears of the diſconſolate <hi>Stratonica.</hi> When ſhe heard of the leave which the Gentlemen asked him to bring their Ladies thither, going together with the King to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Bed, ſhe conferred with him about the buſineſs, and deſired him to be pleaſed, that the Banquet might be kept in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>He, who by the greatneſs of his ſickneſs, was not ſo eſtranged from himſelf, as not to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what degree of malignity his condition was arrived at, which made uſe even of Feaſts for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Melancholly, when he ſaw that to deny his Conſent was to diſpleaſe his Friends, ſhrugged patiently his Shoulders, and intimated to the Queen, That they might do there what ſhe pleaſed. Leave being obtained in this maner, the jolly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly delayed not to crowd themſelves together
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180450:53"/>within the Princes Room. The Ladies appeared in the moſt extravagant Faſhion that their Glaſſes could adviſe them unto. The Gold and Gems, which by reaſon of the Torches blazed within their Cloaths, increaſed the ſplendor of their Faces, and took away the light from others Eyes. A ſight miſerably fortunate, to whoſe teſtimony even the brightneſs of the Lights was a Lyar. And who could with reaſon commend that Pomp for Beautiful, which judged to be guilty by it ſelf, they ſaw tyed in Chains, and ſtoned with Jewels? Many of the Ladies, as enemies to mankinde, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that Nature had not imparted that Beauty to them which they would have had, martyrizing with Curling-Irons their Hair, and poyſoning with Sublimate their Cheeks, had reſolved to kill whoſoever beheld them. Now when they had taken their places in order to their Quality, they heard the Air beaten with very pleaſant Muſick, by a regulated Confuſion of ſeveral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>A Ball is the Feets ſenſuality. It is raiſed with noiſe, and evaporates with wearineſs. Nature (that is the beginning of Motion) would not enrich the Head ſo with Senſe, as to leave the Foot quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it. Even this takes its time to be Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; neither is there any Itch that more foments Luxury then a Ball. It can confirm Love with a fortunate Madneſs among its changing Motions, and unite the Will with the meaſure of ſhort Diſtances.</p>
               <p>The Lovers danced, being onely then happy
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180450:54"/>with their Miſtreſſes, becauſe they did exerciſe the Acts of Inconſtancy. They might call the Dance their Benefactor, for they received not greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of any other action then that. To have the means of ſeeing, of ſpeaking to, and touching the hand of their Miſtreſs, they could not but eſteem a great happineſs; but to be bowed to by her, and invited to move to the very ſame Motion with her, they could not but eſteem the greateſt happineſs.</p>
               <p>But the Queen (who together with the King was expoſed to a tryal, by ſitting over againſt her <hi>Antiochus</hi>) being much more obſerved by <hi>Licofro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> then ſhe willingly would have been, could not feed her Eyes at Pleaſure with that paleneſs, which rendring compaſſionate the Countenance of the Prince, was made the deareſt Mark of her looks. Yet who can relate with what affection ſhe ſent out at that time a ſprightly look, to diſcover by ſtealth in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> if he yet was aware, that ſhe would not any longer make uſe of that ſeverity, which for the rigid Nurſes conſideration, ſhe had many times practiſed againſt him? The poor ſick Prince reduced on the one ſide to behold himſelf before that Beauty, which always with too eloquent a Tongue did dictate tacite perſwaſions to his heart, on the other neceſſitated to contemplate the Countenance of his Father, who with very great compaſſion of his ſickneſs, informed him how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing he was to offend him, did not know (though he was reſolved to dye) to what determination to revolve the ſum of his reſolutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes</hi> the ſtranger was ſeated at the Feaſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180450:54"/>near <hi>Hermogenes.</hi> He, whether it were by the power of Sympathy, or deſire (for ſome ſecret end of his) to intrinſecate himſelf in the Phyſicians affections, had before laid with him the foundation of a very firm friendſhip. Being therefore asked by him, whom he ſaw in a brown ſtudy, What think you on (he ſaid unto him) O <hi>Climenes!</hi> are Feaſts further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoughts? I thought (anſwered the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman) that he who would aptly repreſent this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſembly, could compare it to nothing but a perfect Sphaer. Behold the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> which as neareſt Eternity, is conſtituted of a Circle of the oldeſt. If you ask for the Heaven of fixed Stars, ſee the Ring of the Yong men; If that of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, behold the Orb of the Ladies. If the Earth, behold the ſpace where they Dance; If the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Fortune, ſee the Ball. And if laſtly, O <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> you deſire to ſee Mirth there, look on <hi>Stratonica;</hi> If ſorrow, behold <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed to have Conceits of the Stars (replied <hi>Hermogenes</hi>) you could not chooſe any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject but Heaven. Howſoever I wonder not, That he who has a Chryſtalline Sky in his Brain, ſhould diſcourſe of the Sphaers as of things which he well underſtands.</p>
               <p>I allow, replyed the other, That I have a Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Sky in my Brain, if it be true, that the Chryſtalline Sky being a Place repleniſhed with Divinity, hath nothing for its Object but Beauty. And how is it poſſible for me to have no Conceits of the Stars in the Preſence of ſo many Suns? And when he had made here a beautiful Catalogue of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180450:55"/>all thoſe Ladies, which ſeemed to him to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above the reſt, he canonized with the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own Eloquence the other Beauty's Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>So they diſcourſed together; when a Tumult on the ſudden aroſe which was not underſtood, and diſordered the Feaſt. Every one being amazed, looked ſtedfaſtly towards the place from whence the noiſe came, and they ſaw that the Gentlemen confuſedly riſing up, ran towards the Bed of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> The Multitude encreaſed out of curioſity, and they asking one another what the matter was there, many knew it not, and many durſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. The melodious Sounds ceaſed, the Ladies were affrighted, and the Hall which but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was not capable of holding them for their Jollity and Laughing, became in an inſtant a Deſert full of Solitude and Terror.</p>
               <p>A Curtain was drawn, within which the King and the Queen were concealed, ſo as it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Antiochus</hi> (although he were near) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what it was; and ſoon after a ſad voyce iſſued forth, commanding every one to go home.</p>
               <p>So worldly Joys end. The company went away mute, Terrified and Cautious. The hours of the Night (it being then the deadeſt time of Silence and Obſcurity) encreaſed ſo the horror in their Mindes, that many of them thought that they ſhould not get alive to their houſes. Fear is then the greateſt, when we know not what to fear.</p>
               <p>The good ſick Prince called aloud to thoſe of his Chamber, deſiring them earneſtly to tell him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:180450:55"/>what had happened; whereupon to content him, they anſwered him at laſt, That <hi>Stratonica</hi> had been a little while in a ſwoon.</p>
               <p>What News is this, O <hi>Antiochus?</hi> thy Goddeſs diſcovers her ſelf to be Mortal, and runneſt thou not to behold this Miracle? Thy Life languiſhes near death, and lyeſt thou Stupid in a lazy bed in the Arms of the Thoughts of thy frivolous Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows? Who's there? help to dreſs me. When the Soul is about to free it ſelf from the Boſom where Love hath impriſoned it, it is not good to keep its Body far from it. Go to, go to, O <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> lets haſten to our dangers. But mad Man, what doſt thou? Heaven pitying thy Miſeries, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a way for thee to happineſs without injuring thy Reſolutions, and thou Ignorant of thy own good, precipitateſt thy ſelf into thoſe Impatiences, which are undoubted prejudices to thy Modeſty. Thou haſt reſolved to dye, to behold no more <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonica,</hi> and can'ſt thou not endure that <hi>Stratonica</hi> ſhould dye, to obtain without thy hurt the ſame end? Ah dear one, too well beloved! Ah dear one, too much abhorred!</p>
               <p>So the poor Prince's Minde was diſquieted at the news, which could not ſtrike his Ear without paſſing to his Heart. In the mean time the rumor encreaſed in the Court. The Guards in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace were doubled. They ſent haſtily to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for Soldiers, and gave many other ſecret Orders.</p>
               <p>In the Morning about break of Day <hi>Clitarcus</hi> was carried to Priſon. He next to <hi>Antiochus</hi> was the neareſt of kin to the King, ſo as if he dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180450:56"/>out Iſſue, <hi>Clitarcus</hi> ſucceeded in the Kingdom. This his ſudden impriſonment being divulged, cauſed various admiration and ſorrow in all. Yet all were of a minde that it was by <hi>Arſinda</hi>'s perſecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arſinda</hi> was a Princeſs of the Blood, rich in Poſſeſſions and Opinion. Being left a Widow without any Iſſue but a Daughter, ſhe reſolved to live near the King, as under the ſhadow of a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who could on all occaſions aſſiſt her. Her Daughter grew apace, who was called <hi>Euripia,</hi> but grew with very little Obligation to Nature; for ſhe had neither Beauty of Body, nor endowment of the Minde. But the Mother, who by reaſon of the greatneſs of her Birth, was extreamly Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, being infinitely proud in her expreſſions, and of a fiery behavior, had directed her Thoughts to too ſublime Marks. She knowing that <hi>Clitar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> might ſucceed to the Crown, had fooliſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>Euripia</hi> for his Wife; and intended ſo to operate in the end, that he by the death of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ſhould be ſure of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This her deſign was favored, by ſeeing that the Gentleman inſinuated himſelf ſo much into her friendſhip, that he almoſt ſeemed to ſue for her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. But their ends being diſcovered to them both, they began to hate mortally one another. Now when Noon was paſt, and that the Changes at Court had been ſettled as well as they could, <hi>Stratonica</hi> came to viſit <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fair Queen went in; but before ſhe went in, what reflections made ſhe not? The ſad Queen remembred her ſelf, that ſhe went in to viſit that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180450:56"/>ſick man, in whoſe Boſom her own Soul was Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh. She cared not for repreſſing her Paſſions, as ſhe had done ſo many other times, becauſe ſhe was not fearful of her husbands arrival who kept then his bed. The Colours in her face (the lights of the Tempeſts in the Minde) appeared ſometimes kindled, ſometimes gaſtly, in order to the ſeveral affections with which ſhe felt her ſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly agitated. Hope taught her to make uſe of the opportunity of time, to diſcover once that Fire, which at laſt had reduced into Aſhes her Lifes moſt dear Delights. Fear on the other ſide ſet before her the danger of the Action, and the Obligations of Honor. What wilt thou do, poor <hi>Stratonica,</hi> ſince the conſequences of a ſudden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity have placed thee in a ſtraight of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Shut the Eyes of thy Minde, and go as it were into the Dark, to run that hazard which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath decreed thee. So reaſoning with her ſelf, neither reſolved nor yet wavering, the unfortunate Queen at laſt urged her ſelf to ſalute her adored Prince.</p>
               <p>What appears to thy Eyes from the ſpace of the door, O <hi>Antiochus?</hi> What Sun of Beauty comes, O happy unfortunate Prince, to clear up the darkneſs of thy Sorrows? Thy weakneſs will never be able to endure the force of ſo many Lights.</p>
               <p>The encounter of thoſe firſt Looks cauſed a fainting to them both. <hi>Antiochus</hi> congealed not, for the heat of his Feaver did not yield to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quality. Yet his forehead was beſprinkled with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:180450:57"/>a cold ſweat, and the Pulſe of his Hand grown ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, remained without Motion. He bluſhed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mute.</p>
               <p>How do you Prince, began the Queen. Ah Madam, do you couzen ſo the ſick? There's no deceit at all, be merry, replyed <hi>Stratonica,</hi> I have great things to tell you, but alter not, all hath gone well. Its no longer in my power not to alter, O Madam. And when <hi>Antiochus</hi> haid ſaid ſo, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes languiſhingly on the Eyes of his Life, he remained a little while without ſpeaking. Then taking a little breath, I cannot deny (he added) but that ſince yeſternight till this time, I have been in a continual Agony; for albeit by all which were ſent to ſee your Majeſty, I was always informed you were better, yet I overcharged with too much fear, could not be induced to believe them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. But now to my great conſolation, I perceive by your Countenance, that they told me even leſs then the truth.</p>
               <p>Pardon a Lye in your Servants, O Prince, ſince they ſaid ſo to make you overcome a Diſguſt. Not I, but the King was troubled the laſt night with an Accident which ſtill keeps him a Bed, though without any danger by the Favor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Alas ſaid the anxious ſick Prince, was my Father deſtempered? I, my Dear; but alter not at it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Stratonica.</hi> I perceiving the Accident ran quickly to help <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and ſome Gentlemen ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſtir, ſtirred likewiſe, among whom <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Cimones</hi> taking him up between their Arms,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180450:57"/>carried him unto the firſt Bed that they came to. When the Phyſicians were come and found the King Pulſeleſs, one of them was not wanting to ſay ſoftly, He was dead. This report being ſpread through the Pallace, the tumults it cauſed are not eaſie to be told. The Captain of the Guard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced himſelf with men. They ſent away the Gueſts from the Feaſt. A Preſident made haſte to levy Soldiers in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and every thing in fine was Deplorable and Dreadful. His Swooning laſted almoſt an hour, of which being recovered at laſt, I comforted him with ſome Remedies; and when every one was commanded away, I asked him, if he could not imagine the cauſe, that had the power to diſtemper him ſo grievouſly. He taking my hand between his, after he had been a while ſilent, anſwered me Sighing, that being at the Feaſt, and beholding how every one was merry and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that onely among them all his beloved <hi>Antiochus</hi> extended on a Bed, abounded with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the Arms of a deſperate Melancholly, he had by that reflection ſo contracted his heart, that unable to ſway longer himſelf, he ceaſed to live, and fainted under his Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Unadviſed <hi>Stratonica!</hi> If thou aimeſt at all <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> his Love, why doſt turn with that relation the ſtream of his Affections to the duty of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Knoweſt thou not that onely the Love of his Father oppoſes thy love?</p>
               <p>With what pity was the Prince not wounded, hearing of his Fathers ſo tender, ſo humane an Affection? He inſtantly pondered his Merits in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180450:58"/>the ſpace of a moment: So afterwards he ſaid to himſelf, For a Father like mine, I rather ſhould die, rather be annihilated, then come to have a Thought that might offend him. And here being unable to contain his Tears, he ſoftly brake forth, Ah moſt dear Father, moſt Beloved!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who though late, yet knew that to mollifie the Rigors of her Dear with other pity but that, which ſhe of her ſelf could awaken in his Heart, was to prejudice her Pretences, attended to draw away his Minde to other Thoughts, and ſpinning out the Relation, went on:</p>
               <p>While I ſtood ſo diſcourſing with the King, a Page came to tell us, That <hi>Terpandius</hi> the Prieſt demanded Audience for ſome very earneſt buſineſs. He was brought in unto us, and we eaſily read in his Countenance, the Characters of ill News. When he had done his accuſtomed Duty, he began in this maner:</p>
               <p>Sir, my deſire to ſave your Life, urges me at this ſo unſeaſonable a time to trouble your repoſe. Your Majeſty is to know, That <hi>Hermogenes</hi> died juſt now, who was killed in going home. Before he had breathed out his Soul (I being his Neighbor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal Friend) he ſent for me to him, and ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (having wallowed up and down in his Blood) ſaid to me, <hi>Terpandius,</hi> go to the King, and inform him, That I ſeduced by <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> have poyſoned the Drink which his Majeſty uſes to take every morning; and that <hi>Clitarcus</hi> ſeeing that the King did not die of his ſwooning, being doubtful that I either deluded him, or diſcovered it, hath cauſed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:180450:58"/>me to be ſlain. Entreat him to beware of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of others, and to pardon my Treaſon. I deſired to ask him more Queſtions to diſcover ſomething elſe, but the Froſt of Death beginning at that time to ſtiffen his Tongue, he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn me any Anſwer. May, O King, this advice be as uſeful to you, as my Affection preſents it; and be pleaſed not to mention who truly advertiſes you of it, leſt <hi>Clitarcus</hi> fall foul on me likewiſe.</p>
               <p>When we had heard that ſo Tragical ſtory, we could not leave wondering, that a Prince ſo near unto us in Blood, and a Phyſician of that credit for his Faithfulneſs, would have ever undertaken ſo enormous a deed: Yet when we had made ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, in order to ſomething that was noted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in the Actions of theſe two wicked men, the King had ſome Foundation on which to build his Doubt. To that end he conſulting long with me, we reſolved at laſt to impriſon <hi>Clitarcus.</hi> The thing now done, and break of day not yet peeping, imagine dear <hi>Antiochus</hi> if we reſted that night. But I think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again on the courſe of things which ſucceeded, was doubtful leſt <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who had drunk the Poyſon, albeit his firſt ſwooning was over, might again be ſurprized. But <hi>Carneades</hi> not delaying to arm him with ſtrong Antidotes, did free me in part from that Doubt. That which ſince wholly hath aſſured his Life, and rid me of my Fear, was the knowledge I had, That the Cup-bearer putting the poyſoned Drink into a little Vaſe of Purſlain, it no ſooner was full, but the Vaſe breaking to pieces, ſpilt all the Liquor; whereupon without
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180450:59"/>ſpeaking a word, as ſoon as he had mixed a new Draught, he brought it to <hi>Seleucus</hi> in another Cup to drink. Behold, O Prince, if Fortune hath done miracles for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Wonder and Sorrow in hearing of Succeſſes ſo ſtrange, were ſuch as may well be beleeved of ſo pious a Son. He anſwered and asked the Queen many Queſtions; and ſhe in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſpeaking more with her Eyes then her Tongue, omitted no means to inform her Beloved, That if others did deſign Conjurations againſt the Life of the Father, ſhe contrived Snares againſt the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Son.</p>
               <p>While they two ſo reaſoned together, behold a Gentlewoman asks in all haſte for <hi>Stratonica;</hi> Madam, the King ſtayes expecting you. The fair Queen took her leave: The Gods know with what Heart. The Remembrance of her coming to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her ſelf to her Dear, and departing before ſhe had done any thing, awaked ſuch Reſentments in her Minde, as cannot be otherwiſe expreſſed, but with a weeping ſilence.</p>
               <p>Go thy ways, O unfortunate Queen, to reward the moſt cruel Repulſes of thy Lover, with the ſweet Embraces with which thy Husband hath always received thee. Laſtly, though he is old, <hi>Seleucus</hi> alone is he that adores thee.</p>
               <p>But being come to her Husband, ſhe was ſhot with the Arrow of Terror, by the Bow of an angry Eye-brow. Alas, to what Diſaſter are ſuch Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſigns the Prologue?</p>
               <p>Know you this hand, <hi>Stratonica?</hi> And ſhe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:180450:59"/>Yes: Reade the Letters, and then I will tell you the reſt, replyed the King. <hi>Stratonica</hi> began to reade with that Alteration, which the ſurprizal of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Misfortune, and the fierceneſs of an unuſual look from <hi>Seleucus,</hi> could probably be the cauſe of. And when ſhe had declared in the various colours (with which her Cheek was dyed) the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtings which her Soul was wounded with; I ſee (ſhe ſaid) O King, theſe are my Fathers Letters, but I cannot comprehend what deſigns he hath practiſed with <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> and how I am promiſed to him for his Wife.</p>
               <p>Then the old King unable to contain himſelf longer, cryed out, Ah <hi>Stratonica, Stratonica,</hi> your Father hath always conſpired againſt me, and with too implacable hatred (when he could not deprive me of my Life) laid wait for mine Honor! And proceeding in telling her with how much Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>Demetrius</hi> had returned the Affection which he always had born him, he upbraided <hi>Stratonica</hi> with the ſundry Favors he had done him, and the many Occaſions he had had of ſuppreſſing him. Then with an act truly horrible, he ſwore by the Life of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to hold him no longer either for his Father-in-law, or his Friend, but perſecuting him perpetually, to ſpend his own blood to procure his Death. And he proteſted, That if it had not been indecent for his Honor, he would have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Stratonica</hi> to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as an eternal refuſal of his Blood, and of his Friendſhip. For his minde every way preſaged to him little good that by her he was ever like to have.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:180450:60"/>
               <p>So <hi>Seleucus</hi> vented his Paſſion, becauſe in the Letters of <hi>Demetrius</hi> there was this particular, <hi>Be confident of the Friend, whom I have ſent thither for that purpoſe.</hi> He conſulted who was meant by this Friend, and <hi>Climenes</hi> much ſuſpected by him, he ſuddenly cauſed him to be ſecretly impriſoned.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who by reaſon of the words of the King, had ſtaid in the Room as one ſmitten by a Thunder-bolt, being unable any longer to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age her Diſaſter, departed from the ſight of her Husband, and incloſing her ſelf in the moſt remote Room that was to be found in the very bottom of the Pallace, when ſhe perceived that ſhe had no other witneſs of her Sorrow, but her own Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Why ſhould I live longer (ſhe began) unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Woman, in a time when Heaven is reſolved to Rain on thy Life all Diſaſters? To what hopes doth that Blinde Fortune reſerve longer my Yong years, that never knew how to diſtribute her Favors, but where they are merited leaſt? I condemned to frieze in the inſipid Colds of an aged Husband, while I burn in the unprofitable flames of a yong Lover? I a follower of him, who for loving me too much, is come now to hate me? I poſſeſs a Beauty, whoſe Flowers have been watered perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with my Tears? And ſhould I live in the World? Should I look on the Sun? Suck in the Air? Walk up and down on the Earth? Ah no, Unfortunate <hi>Stratonica.</hi> It is no longer time to live. Die poor Queen, and if thy Sorrow cannot kill thee, have recourſe to the helps of Iron and Poyſon.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:180450:60"/>
               <p>Where art <hi>Demetrius,</hi> my Father, my Hope, that thou ſeeſt not the Tears of thy <hi>Stratonica?</hi> Of that dear Daughter, whom thou ſo often hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy Boſom, and laying to thy Face, haſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bowels of thy Life? If at leaſt when this Heart ſhall no longer be able to breathe, when the colours ſhall fade in my Face, and theſe Eyes want the power to look upwards, thou ſhouldſt come opportunely to ſay to me, Go hence in Peace my Daughter; my Paſſage would be happy.</p>
               <p>So mourned the Delight of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Love of <hi>Soria.</hi> And her Tears had no body to comfort them, her Sighs no body to receive them. So thoſe dear Eyes, thoſe divine Cheeks, and that heavenly Countenance, were by cruel Deſtiny condemned to Sorrow. And ſhall my Pen paſs over her cruel Afflictions, without rending in pieces my Heart at every Motion? Ah let us go on, O Reader! We cannot without Sacriledge deſcribe a weeping Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> in the mean time aſſured the next day of his health, fell to thanking the Gods, by giving order for Sacrifices. The ſlaughtered Victimes fumed every where on the Altars, and by writing on the Ground with the Characters of Blood the Kingdoms Joys; nothing it ſeems but Purple Ink could witneſs the common Affections for the health of the King. The devotedſt Vaſſals pretended, That within thoſe ſacred Flames their Hearts burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then the Holocauſts; and with the Tongues of Smoke thanking Heavens Protections, they the ſame time offered Incenſe with acts of Adulation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:180450:61"/>to <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Ambition. It is hard to relate how many Embaſſies of Princes arrived in few days at the Court, to congratulate with him his recovered Health, and how many publike and private Feaſts were made through all <hi>Soria</hi> for that occaſion.</p>
               <p>Onely <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> Princes truly worthy of another Condition then what they then enjoyed, the one extended on a Bed, and the other buried in a Priſon, made a dolorous Deſcant to the Harmony of thoſe Joys.</p>
               <p>A Priſon is a Hell epitomized in Ten ſpans of Scituation. Humane cruelty, which in tracing of Torments, hath imitated always diabolical Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath in no other Machine more expreſſed the Marrow of Barbariſm, then in the Invention of a Priſon. It is the ſum of Evils, becauſe it is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Liberty, the ſum of all Happineſs. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions of the Body, and Diſaſters of the Minde, be they never ſo great, come never to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrize all our Senſes at once as a Priſon does. Even Hope, that is the comfort of every Evil, becomes in a Priſon the diſquieting of the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clitarcus</hi> was environed with Chains in a Room ſo full of Sadneſs, that the Darkneſs in it did the office of Pity.</p>
               <p>Its Horror which ſhewed not the Inhabitant there all his Miſeries at once, might call in a maner a Loſs, a Benefactor. Loaden more with Thoughts then with Irons, the wretch lay on a Bed, which with too great a poverty, was fain both to ſerve him for a Table and Repoſe. Solitude, which was the greateſt Company he had, could give him no eaſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180450:61"/>with other Conferences, but thoſe of a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly ſilence. Onely the Sighs which too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued out of his Breaſt (more pitiful then any thing elſe) ſtrove to break thoſe Walls, which too unworthily conſtituted a miſerable Pallace to a Prince diſgraced by Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whom it greatly concerned to finde out the Fact, not ſo much to puniſh the guilty, as to know in what maner the offence was deviſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by vertue of the Laws he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, whom he had not proofs againſt to convince, was extreamly diſquieted concerning this Matter. And he was the more diſquieted, by how much that deſiring by a certain occult alienation of Minde to condemn <hi>Climenes,</hi> he ſaw that if <hi>Clitarcus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed not ſomething, he ſhould be compelled to free him. <hi>Seleucus</hi> toſſed up and down between theſe Doubts, was not wanting oftentimes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Thoughts to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who relaxing a little the rigor of his deſpair, by reaſon of theſe Affairs, deſired very earneſtly to know how the buſineſs was managed. He counſelled therefore his Father (ſince there was no other remedy) to cauſe <hi>Clitarcus</hi> to be beheaded by his abſolute Power. For ſince they were diſcuſſing ſo enormous an Offence, it was not blame-worthy at all, to come thither by way of Equity, where they could not arrive by way of Juſtice. <hi>Antiochus</hi> forgat not (though he meant not to live) that <hi>Clitarcus</hi> could onely oppoſe him in the Crown. Whereupon, not onely for this Reaſon, which is always very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Mindes of Princes, but likewiſe for the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:180450:62"/>love which he bare unto his Father, he ſtrove by all means to procure their Deſtruction, who had ſtudied to offend him. Moreover, theſe Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prince were fomented by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Rage, which againſt <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> but more againſt <hi>Climenes, Licofronia</hi> made daily. For ſhe loving the King very dearly, but withal more affectionately <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was not able to endure, that they ſhould go unpuniſhed by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, who were ſuſpected guilty of Treaſon againſt the King. She was changed in that maner on the ſudden (as Women uſe to be) againſt the unfortunate <hi>Climenes:</hi> And if at the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been her Sons Friend, ſhe had brought him by her Favors to the height of the greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at Court, now becauſe he might be thought to be guilty, ſhe labored by all means to bring him into hatred with all the World; and perſecuting him with all her might, ſhe ſwore, That if he even had been her own Son, ſhe would have had the courage to behold without weeping his Head ſevered from the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> then adhering to the Counſel of the Prince, without making more ado, cauſed death to be intimated to <hi>Clitarcus.</hi> It was greatly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Councel of State, ſince the King had no other Succeſſor (beſides <hi>Antiochus</hi>) but his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, if it was not expedient for the Crown to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him alive againſt all Miſchances. But <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſpeaking gravely, ſaid to them, That he deſired not to leave him the Crown, who deſerved the Ax; that his Succeſſion could not have better fortune
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:180450:62"/>then to end with Vertue, never to begin with Vice; and that he could not poſſibly be ſo impious, to recommend his peoples Life and Protection to one, who not knowing how to ſpare his own Blood, had attempted to leap into the Throne with the foot of Homicide.</p>
               <p>Behold <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> what an end to thy life that Star hath determined, which beholding thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity with too unlucky a ray, hath imprinted incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in thy Minde, which muſt make thee do infamous Things.</p>
               <p>Puniſhment is not always remote from Noble Perſons. Princes even dye in that maner as the baſeſt men expire. For the Sword of Juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts onely Innocence from its Edge.</p>
               <p>The Conſpirator was at this paſs, and yet his ſorrows fell very much ſhort of the ſorrows which the Queen did feel for the diſaſter of her Love. She ſeeing in the Court ſo many diſguſts of Wars, of Conſpiracies and Diſeaſes, and perceiving that they treated of nothing but Revenges, Priſons and Axes; and that which is worſe, finding her ſelf vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by her Husband, contemned by her Lover, and far from her Father, fell into ſo cruel a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, that ſhe wanted but a little of Raving.</p>
               <p>The freſh Comelineſs in her face being therefore decay'd, and the Colours of Beauty turned Pale, the unfortunate Queen reſembled nothing elſe in her Countenance, but a nocturnal Heaven, in which the Sun of Joy was put out. She was glad to be alone, and glad to weep, to waſh perhaps with Tears thoſe Spots of Immodeſty, which her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:180450:63"/>Looks might have Printed in the Chryſtal of her Minde.</p>
               <p>Being now (to ſay ſo) habituated to mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpleaſure, ſhe was at that paſs, to be able to look <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the face without any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be unmoleſted though ſhe ſaw him not at all. All the reſtaurative ſhe allowed the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Minde, was the ſound of a Cymbal, which with its Strings of Steel rendring warlike the Harmony, by force overcame (though it were in a ſhort ſpace of time) the Army of Paſſions by which ſhe found her ſelf to be beſieged.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In love, what's Beauty worth though rare,</l>
                  <l>But to cauſe torment to a Heart?</l>
                  <l>No matter for fine Golden Hair</l>
                  <l>Or Cheeks by Nature Red, or Art.</l>
                  <l>Ah! Beauty can us onely move,</l>
                  <l>'Tis Fate that cauſes Death for Love.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So ſhe made an end of ſinging one day, when a ſealed Paper came to her hands, which was brought her very cautiouſly by one of her faithfulleſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>The Letter came from <hi>Clitarcus.</hi> He ſeeing himſelf near to death, and being not unwilling to dye; but becauſe he could no longer beatifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſerving his deareſt <hi>Stratonica,</hi> reſolved to write her this Letter, and in it to excuſe his own Actions, that he might in ſome ſort make them ſeem to the Queen the leſs faulty. <hi>Stratonica</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually accuſtomed to finde ſome black diſaſter
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180450:63"/>in white Paper, did not open it without fear, nor reade it without alteration. The Contents ſaid as followeth:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>MADAM, <hi>Since my life is ſo near to an end, that I may no longer reckon Days but Hours, I muſt not go out of this world, without taking leave of you, who have always been my Patroneſs; nor leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in your Minde an Opinion cruel to my ſelf, without making you that excuſe for it, which the Duty I profeſs you requires. If therefore perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture with little ſatisfaction to your Pleaſure, I have induced you to reade this Letter, excuſe my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, and be not diſpleaſed with my boldneſs. For albeit I know, that to ſay nothing of it, or confeſs it, neither makes me lyable to death, or delivers me from it; yet I ſhould be very glad, that what you ſhall reade here within, may perpetually be buried in the bottom of your Heart. I ſhall never be cenſured for confiding in you; for beſides that in you all thoſe qualities concur, which can aſſure me of your ſecrecy, I may always ſay to have truſted in my life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You already know Madam (and you know it too well, unfortunate that I am) That I was born to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore you. My Age encreaſing by the Rayes of your Beauty, was no otherwiſe life to me, then I had hope to obtain your good Grace.</hi> Arſinda <hi>the Princeſs obſerving my qualities, was taken with them, and deſigned them to the Fortune of her Daughter. I likewiſe reflecting on her parts, eſteemed her very fit to implore for me your Love. She met with me as a friend on the Trace of her Ends, I followed her on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180450:64"/>the Footſteps of my Wiſhes, as one whom ſhe truſted. The relation of my Paſsions ſucceeded the beginning of our friendſhip. Whereupon ſhe diſcovering an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to gain me, on the one ſide undertook my aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance very willingly, on the other cauſed me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of the effect; being ſecure by theſe Arts to looſe me from your Love, and tye me to that of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; You know, O Queen, the offices, the tryals and perſwaſions which ſhe uſed to you in my name. Your cruelty was my ruine and her anger. When ſhe ſaw that neither by your rigid behavior towards me, I sould be diverted from you, nor by her allurements be induced to love</hi> Euripia, <hi>ſhe reſolved to perſecute me. It occurs not to ſurvey again Diſtaſtes. It is to no body more known then to your ſelf, to what tryals ſhe hath often expoſed my Reputation and Life. But now ſince I muſt dye, I forgive her all offences, and love her as formerly. Finding then my ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of her aſsiſtance, and deſpairing to have you as a Miſtreſs, I did caſt about how to gain you for my Wife. The diſſentions between your Father and Husband, were the foundation on which I erected my Engines. Suppoſe me a Lover, and you'll grant all exorbitances! You would offend your wiſdom, if you wondered and examined my Actions. It is ſufficient. The buſineſs went on well, if the breaking of a Vaſe of Purſlain had not ruined in a moment my Fortunes. Heaven, that knew me unworthy of your Love, would not let me have the experience of the worth of your favor. Your Beauty, which hath made all men happy, hath rendered me onely unfortunate. A juſt puniſhment of the Gods, who knowing that by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:180450:64"/>adoring you, I preferred you before them, would not let me brag that I had couzened them of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, without loſing my life. So go the things of the world, O</hi> Stratonica! Clitarcus <hi>born a Prince, grown up to the Hopes of a Kingdom, endowed with good Qualities, beloved of Vaſſals, and reverenced by Strangers, is brought to be be headed in the Flower of his Age. I dye O deareſt (diſpence with me, if at the end of my life I make uſe of this word) I dye full of all thoſe diſcontents, and abandoned by all thoſe Conſolations, which in Caſes like this, have at any time been of force to encourage every other wretched man. My death would be happy, if I might be aſſured, that theſe my diſaſters were but pityed by one ſingle drop of your Eyes. But it is temerity to aſpire ſo high. I know your Eyes in that they are Stars, are mine Enemies, and I muſt not hope for pity from mine Enemies. Be you happy, O Madam!</hi>

               <p>It is hard to relate how many impreſſions the Letter made in the Minde of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> in order to Affection and Pity. The ſad Queen upbraided her misfortunes to Heaven, ſince in the firſt ending to finde one that loves her, ſhe began to loſe him. In fine, ſhe could not chooſe but communicate the Letter to <hi>Arſinda,</hi> who then was her Beloved, her Favorite. And ſo much the more willingly ſhe communicated it to her, by how much that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had ſeen, that <hi>Arſinda</hi> following the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of womaniſh inconſtancy, having changed all the Hatred ſhe bare to <hi>Clitarcus,</hi> into an Affection and an unſpeakable Pity, had made her ſelf famous
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:180450:65"/>among others of the Court, by bewailing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous Condition. When they had then conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long together, <hi>Arſinda</hi> without ſpeaking any more had recourſe to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and informed him with moſt powerful Reaſons, That now ſince <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarcus</hi> was contented to dye without confeſſing any thing, it was expedient to the Crown, to diſcover the Wiles and Treacheries of his Enemies by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him his life, in caſe he would manifeſt their deſign. The King was moſt unwilling to Conſent to this Reſolution. But laſtly, when he knew of what uſe it was to him, he Condeſcended to all <hi>Arſinda</hi> deſired. When ſhe had obtained this Grace, ſhe was doubtful of <hi>Clitarcus</hi> his kindneſs, though in the Queens Letter ſhe had had ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of it before. Whereupon it ſeemed neceſſary to her, before ſhe would Treat with him of any thing, to penetrate his Minde with a Note. She therefore wrote to him very kindly, and aſſured him how much from her heart ſhe repented her ſelf, that ſhe ever had diſpleaſed him, and how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſhe grieved to ſee he was brought to ſuch an end:</p>
               <p>When <hi>Clitarcus</hi> had read the Note, he thought without doubt, That <hi>Arſinda</hi> would even in the end of his life, afflict him with ſome ſpecious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Yet diſſembling his doubt, he anſwered her thus in a Letter:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <opener>

                     <p>
                        <hi>TO purchaſe your good Grace in that Moment, when I am to loſe my life, is a neceſsitating of me, to bewail one thing more that I leave in this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:180450:65"/>world. You would, O</hi> Arſinda, <hi>have uſed greater pity to me, if Treating me like an Enemy in that maner, as you have been to me till juſt now, you had made me unconcerned in the Sorrow of not being longer able to enjoy your Courteſies. You have done nothing elſe by reconciling me to you, but added the weight of your Memory to the burthen I carry to the other World. I impute all to my Stars, which have had the power to make me ſo unhappy, that even Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors prove Misfortunes to me. Howſoever (Madam) I am glad to die lamented by you, ſince I lived before perſecuted by you. And aſſure your ſelf, that he who hath never reſented your Injuries, till forced by his Honor, will never forget your Affection, till maſtered by Eternity.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Arſinda</hi> had received this Letter, ſhe flew full of joy to the Priſon. She complemented and negotiated with <hi>Clitarcus</hi> a good while. In the end ſhe ſo wrought, that he was contented to buy his life at the rate of Confeſſion. The Examination ſucceeded the Charge; and in the Examination he diſcovered many things that were not fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; one of which was, the accuſing of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> for one of the principal Actors in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes</hi> on this Evidence was moſt cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; but aſſuring himſelf that he could by no means eſcape Death, he declined the reſidue of his Torments, by ſaying, He was ready to reveal every thing, provided, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Licofronia</hi> would be preſent at his Tryal. Then the Preſidents
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180450:66"/>of the Cauſe being aſſembled together in the Chamber of the Prince, together with <hi>Licofronia,</hi> who, as zealous of the life of the King, had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted extreamly in all things the ſaid guilty Perſon; The Judges had ſcarce taken their places, but they heard the noiſe of the Irons which <hi>Climenes</hi> trail'd along on the ground.</p>
               <p>The poor Youth appeared like a Traveller into another life. His Countenance (which by Nature had no vulgar Air in it) grown lean by Affliction, expreſſed in a pale diſagreement of Colours, that the Harmony of his <hi>individuum</hi> began its Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Head. They read in the Apple of his Eye, Tears manfully repelled, and Horrors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly deſigned by Death. Yet when he had rallied the Reliques of a Chearfulneſs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was diſperſed, with a ſmiling that had nothing elſe of life but the ſhadow, he ſpake in this maner:</p>
               <p>To be Mortal, and conſequently ſubject to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Errors, ſhould not make it ſeem ſtrange to you, O Judges, that now before your eyes, ye ſee me faln down to the bottom of humane Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He that incited me to this Precipice, is ſo powerful, that with an example of extraordinary wonder, he could have ſubverted more robuſtious Breaſts, and Hearts far more generous then mine. But I ſpeak not this to diminiſh in any ſort the greatneſs of my Fault, but to aſſure you (my Lords) that what I have deſigned againſt the King, had relation to nothing but Love and Revenge.</p>
               <p>The Phyſicians diſſention in order to your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180450:66"/>(O Prince) was the cauſe, from which ſuch ſad Effects are derived. I am not in a condition to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my Diſcourſe. Hear the true Relation, and pity (if you pleaſe) not my Offence, but my Frailty.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hermogenes</hi> ſaw he was vilified by <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades,</hi> for their Difference in Opinion in order to your Highneſſes diſeaſe; and that to that contempt was joyned the little Favor the King ſhewed him; he being vexed, ſent a Letter to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> my Maſter, ſtrewed full of Ambuſhes and Treaſons, which <hi>Seleucus</hi> deviſed againſt him. And amongſt other things (to confirm them) wrote to him, That the King the laſt year perceiving that your Highneſs was familiar with <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> fearing leſt at laſt you might marry her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> wards <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Kinred, had cauſed her to be poyſoned by <hi>Carneades:</hi> Whereupon the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lady departing ſhortly after for the Death of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> her Father, could ſcarce get to <hi>Burſia</hi> alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who before was perſwaded of the hatred <hi>Seleucus</hi> bare to him, when he ſaw its Effects in <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> did preſently beleeve whatſoever <hi>Hermogenes</hi> wrote to him. Whereupon being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to Revenge (having before made ſure of <hi>Clitarcus</hi> the Prince) he reſolved to ſend to this Court ſome faithful Lord of his, who embracing with him the Deſign, might perſwade him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt the King, and to ſeek by all means, either by Iron or Poyſon to deprive him of Life.</p>
               <p>None of his Barons ſeemed fitter to him for this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180450:67"/>buſineſs, then my ſelf. To that end having drawn me aſide one day, to diſcourſe with him in the ſecreteſt place of one of his Cabinets, when he had complained greatly of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> and ſhewed me the Letters of <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> he commanded me to come to this Court, and told me what to do with <hi>Clitarcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I, who had loved <hi>Sophonisba</hi> more then my life, and that if I came not to this Court when the Queen brought her with her for one of her Ladies, it was, becauſe I was far diſtant at that time from <hi>Burſia,</hi> for certain Affairs of the King, my Maſter; Imagine ye, O Judges, what ſorrow I felt by ſeeing in <hi>Hermogenes</hi> his Letters, not onely the Memory, but the Quality of her Death. Whereupon, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to me, that by obeying the King, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurred the Satisfaction of doing my Duty, but that too of revenging my Lady, I was very willing to perform his Commands.</p>
               <p>It diſordered me onely to think, that I ſhould be known not onely by <hi>Stratonica,</hi> but many others of this Court; but <hi>Demetrius</hi> telling me, that (when I had gotten a Beard, and changed with my Voice in ſome ſort the Features of my Face, I might eaſily be freed of this doubt) did encourage me ſo, that I imbarqued my ſelf for this Coaſt: Being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at Sea by a Tempeſt, I was caſt on the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where forced to expect many Moneths the Commodity of Paſſage, the Relation befel me of that Witch, which I made ſome days paſt to your Highneſs, which differeth in nothing from the Truth, but in that particular onely, in which I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180450:67"/>made mention of my Father, and in the Infirmities which I ſaid I had had in the end.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs I know calls ſomething to minde that I ſignified to you of a Picture which I ſaw there in the Pallace of that Mountain, for whoſe ſake afterwards I could not endure to ſee any other. Now this was the Picture of <hi>Sophonisba.</hi> Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by this ſight more then ever to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, Fortune to facilitate the more my Diſaſters, did likewiſe provide againſt the danger of my being diſcovered; for going a hunting one day, I fell from a very high Precipice of Rocks, and breaking my Noſe and my Teeth, and loſing an Eye, as you ſee, I ſecurely did negotiate with my Friends, and no body knew who I was.</p>
               <p>Being healed, and a very convenient Paſſage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me, I arrived at this Court. Here feigning my ſelf to be a Stranger, as your Highneſs beheld, I onely diſcovered my ſelf to the Prince your Cozen, and procured the Friendſhip of <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes.</hi> The Prince (though he very much deſired it) was troubled in reſolving with himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt the King. But I knowing he was cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Love with the Queen (though ſhe knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it) did promiſe to him on the part of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> to marry her to him as ſoon as <hi>Seleucus</hi> ſhould be dead. He, who was not able to ſtand firm againſt theſe Motions, when the promiſe was authenticated by the Letters of my Maſter, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Hermogenes</hi> with a great ſum of Gold, and many Hopes, and incited him to Poyſon <hi>Seleucus.</hi> As ſoon as I knew that he had done the deed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180450:68"/>(though it was without Effect, by the Rupture of the Vaſe) I killed him the night following, to be ſure he ſhould be ſilent. But by the ſame way that I thought to have ſecured the Secrecy, by that very ſame I happened to reveal it. For <hi>Hermogenes</hi> as ye know having ſo much life left him, as to be able to inform <hi>Terpandius</hi> of the Fact, every thing was diſcovered. So the buſineſs exactly hath paſſed, O Judges. Now it remains (he ſpake with a great ſigh) that ye know who I am; but no body can give greater teſtimony of that then this Lady, who ſits here among you. And in ſaying ſo, ſhewing <hi>Licofronia</hi> a skar that he had on his Arm, now ſpeak you, he added (O Madam) if you know your Son <hi>Alceſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, I have not the courage to delineate the reſentment of a Mother, who after a very long time that ſhe hath been far diſtant from her onely Son, comes to re-behold him with an Ax over his Head. Let him (who can) arrive there with a Thought, where I cannot come with my Pen. I will onely ſay this, The Judges ſo much pitied this caſe, that if his Offence had been any thing but Treaſon, perhaps changing the Puniſhment of Life into ſome other Puniſhment, they might in ſome kinde have been indulgent to him.</p>
               <p>Thou diedſt ſo, O <hi>Alceſtes.</hi> Thy ill Fortune could not be divided from thee, but by the Iron which cut off thy Head. Unfortunate Man! Thy Misfortune would not have been lamented at all, if thou hadſt undertaken the Conſpiracy, ſet on fire by other flames, but thoſe of Revenge and of Love.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:180450:68"/>Where is that Heart, be it never ſo generous, that ſpurred on by theſe two Affections, runs not to any kinde of Precipice? May that be an example to the Liver.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Clitarcus</hi> (who had by the means of <hi>Arſinda</hi> been delivered out of Priſon, and from Death, though perpetually baniſhed from <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) was willing to gratifie in ſome part the kindneſs he had received from that Lady, by marrying <hi>Euripia.</hi> So one of the Conſpirators (becauſe he was a Prince) paſſes to his Nuptials, while the other (becauſe a private man) goes to the Gallows.</p>
               <p>The Diſturbances of <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> being quieted in this maner, and the Court filled with joy for this Marriage, their Contentment was the greater, becauſe <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſeeing his Deſigns were diſcovered, endeavored a Peace with <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and obtained it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> therefore awaked with the noiſe of the Feaſts out of that Melancholly in which her great Beauty lay aſleep, and began to rekindle in her ſelf the accuſtomed ſplendors of her Face, and revive the uſual Graces of her Looks and of Laughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus,</hi> thy Sun prepares himſelf to run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of thy life. What is to be done? Preſerve thy Chaſtity, and thou loſeſt thy Life. So this poor deſperate Prince, when he ſaw in the Roſes of his Enemy, the Thorns of his Condition to re-bloſſom, fell to Faſting again, becauſe he would not nouriſh in the weakneſs of his Life, the danger of his Modeſty.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:180450:69"/>
               <p>But <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who wanted not any thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Happineſs in the Joys of the Peace, but the ſight of ſome amendment in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated wholly to Sacrifices and Devotions, ſpent onely the hours of the day in ſighing to Heaven for ſome reparation to the Ruines of his decaying Son.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> ſome three Miles off, there is a Valley, which within a ſad Pleaſantneſs of <hi>Cypres</hi> Trees, by which it was encumbered by reaſon of their Thickneſs, a Temple lay hid, erected to the Glory of a nameleſs Deity. There Solitude (whoſe Kingdom it ſeemed) commanding with the Scepter of Silence, did intimate to all that entred into the Wood, the decrees of Terror and Admiration.</p>
               <p>The Fabrick (which ſhewed in the Architecture a Majeſty, to which even Ages did homage) aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe Circumſtances of Horror and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which make a doleful Edifice, was reverenced by Pilgrims, as a dwelling that could not contain any other thing in it, but the obſcure Deity of a Power unknown.</p>
               <p>Black Bats, and unlucky Birds, which (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Temple with ſad flutterings) did form an unfortunate Chattering, were the Citizens which inhabiting the Obſcurities of the Wood, accorded to the colours of their Feathers the ſadneſs of thoſe Leaves, which even in their trembling breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tears.</p>
               <p>Hither the King reſolved to have daily recourſe, without any other attendance but two Lords; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident that as he prayed againſt an unknown
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:180450:69"/>Diſeaſe, ſo onely of an unknown Deity he could obtain the Remedy for it. And behold at the third ſtation, when the Sacrifice was done, he ſoundly ſleeps at the Foot of the Altar, and hears a voice in a dream that ſayes unto him,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus,</hi> cauſe <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> to be found. If he cures not thy Son, his Death is unavoidable.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate King awaking with this voice (which ſtruck him like Thunder) returned in all haſte to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And when he had diſtinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, if there was a Phyſician in the World called <hi>Eraſiſtratus;</hi> he received this Anſwer, That there was not onely ſuch a one, but that he was the Vaſſal of his Majeſty; and that it was not long ſince he had married a moſt beautiful Citizen of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King having cauſed <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> to come to him, beheld him Counter-marked with ſo Noble and ſo Comely a Countenance, that by his lively Carriage, and cheerful Condition, he ſtraight-ways preſaged ſome good Fortune to the Cure of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> Poor afflicted men, how quickly they run to beleeve, what they would have ſucceed in order to the effecting their Deſires. All men offend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Levity, but great men there offend moſt of all; for they (as more proud in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires) cannot comprehend how Hope can be ſo bold to deceive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> expoſed to the Eyes of the other Phyſicians, and of the Court, became ſoon a Mark for the blows of Detraction and Envy. But he (who had ſpent the greater part of his time in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180450:70"/>Courts of other Kings, being skilful in the art of inſinuating himſelf into every ones favor) prevailed with them in time no leſs by his Knowledge then his Wit.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Seleucus</hi> (who procured with all diligence that the Phyſician ſhould not be diſtracted with any other Thoughts, but thoſe which were neceſſary for the ſtudy of Remedies) was deſirous that his Wife ſhould be brought into the Court, to live there with him; and gave order to have her Treated as a Lady eſteemed by the Queen.</p>
               <p>Things being compoſed in this maner, <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus</hi> went in to make his firſt viſit to the Prince, and with him <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> the Princes Overſeer. The Room half dark, was the firſt ſign which they all three had of the little Life of the ſick Prince. Their Looks haſtned to the Bed, which (now beginning to transform it ſelf into a Coffin) contained nothing elſe but a miſerable Conjunction of Bones animated by a fugitive Soul. <hi>Antiochus</hi> was defaced in that maner, that having by his ſickneſs acquired a Figure wholly different from himſelf, he retained nothing elſe of his former Similitude, but a lively Look, in which alone, as in a ſecure Counter-ſign, his unfortunate Father was reduced to acknowledge the Stamp of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.</p>
               <p>Nature peradventure then robbing him of his native Form, had with a compaſſionate cruelty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him from the reſidue of thoſe Tears which <hi>Seleucus</hi> would have ſhed by reſeeing in him his own Image. But what greater miſery could arrive
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180450:70"/>to poor <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then to be brought to that paſs, that it ſeemed but reaſonable to defraud him of that weeping to which his Fathers Tears were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted by the law of Compaſſion. Yet the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate King was not wanting to water his Cheeks in that maner, That if the Overſeer and Phyſician there preſent, had not ſignified to him that he ſhould forbear weeping, he would without doubt (forerunning the death of his Son) have provided his dear Body of a Bath. They conſidered him poſſeſſed by Melancholly, oppreſſed with Silence, and abſtracted from Humanity. Every thing about him ſeemed to infuſe Horror, and to ſavor of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Even the Air (infected with his Fate) moved up and down in the Circuit of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomething that was Noyſom and Deadly.</p>
               <p>When the King had made much of him, and frequently asked him how he did, being unable to get from him any anſwer at all but a turning of his ſhoulders, he weeping, conſulted the Phyſician in order to what they ſhould do to revive this dying health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> then taking into his hand the arm of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> obſerved (muſing much) by the drum of his Pulſe, if his Soul yet began to beat the march. Then he ſaid very gravely, That there wanted not cauſes of ſadneſs; That nevertheleſs in that his firſt viſit he durſt not yet prognoſticate any thing of certainty; That he ſhould have thought it a moſt excellent remedy, to cheer up <hi>Antiochus</hi> his ſorrows with much merry Company and ſweet Muſick; for he ſaw very well, that chiefly two
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180450:71"/>things were the infirmities which cauſed his Death, to wit, Melancholly and Weakneſs. The Phyſician going on in his diſcourſe, ſo ſatisfied the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that he hanging at his Mouth, preſerved his Words as anſwers from an Oracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> had the Charge to give order for the Feaſts, and to aſſign the time for the Ladies Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. There the Queen being often to intervene, not onely as chief in Authority, but as principal in Beauty, was the cauſe that the others ſo much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to her (becauſe they would not ſtay in the place) went out with their Attires and Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deviſed without doubt by Emulation, and embroydered by Envy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Chamber being therefore become an Epitome, in which Oſtentation had contracted all its Bravery; and a Scene, where all the Torches of Beauty were lighted, the poor Prince felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mount miſerably towards Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Stratonica,</hi> there was not a Lady (though the Court did abound with extraordinary Beauties) more handſome then <hi>Polibia</hi> the Wife of the Phyſician. She (whoſe years reſembled a Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of Flowers tyed by Youth) ſurpaſſing the others as much as ſhe was ſurpaſſed her ſelf by <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonica,</hi> ſeemed a middle limit placed in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to prove that infinity which the Beauty of the Queen arrived at.</p>
               <p>If I knew which way to deſcribe a Deity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould dare to ſhadow thoſe Sweets, which all Eyes felt by fixing themſelves on the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Queen, while ſhe ſate near the Bed of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180450:71"/>
                  <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to ſolace her ſelf with the reſt of the Ladies. But tis madneſs to attempt an impoſſible thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> (who well underſtood the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Eyes) perceiving that looks paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen and the Prince, which carried and recarried arrows, was not long a comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what tempeſt the Health of <hi>Antiochus</hi> was loſt. Being cautious therefore in obſerving, in leſs then two days he perceived, that every time <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> appeared, the poor Prince (grown pale) was in a ſweat; his Tongue trembled in his Mouth, and his Heart did beat in his Breaſt; and the Motions of his Pulſe varying in that maner, it ſeemed by the frequent beatings that he panted in calling for help.</p>
               <p>Penſive <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> what remedy wilt thou finde for this Princes diſeaſe, now thou haſt had the furtune to diſcover it? He turns to Aſhes for a fire, which nothing ſuits better with then Silence. How wilt thou be able to put thy ſelf in order to make uſe of any Medicaments, if thou mayſt not define the diſeaſe nor ſpeak of it? O my very cruel Condition! And what avails it me, that thou haſt brought me to the greateſt cure in the world (to make me get honor) if thou haſt put a rub in my way, which may make me loſe my life? ſo ſpake ſighingly the Phyſician in that affliction of Minde, who could have no greater Conſolation then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. But after much uncertainty of Thought, he ran to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and informing him that at length he had diſcovered the diſeaſe of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he tells him it is incurable.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:180450:72"/>
               <p>Alas, then (anſwered the King) dareſt thou tell me ſuch unfortunate News? And from what ſo mortal Cauſe is derived a diſeaſe, which my Crown is not able to Cure?</p>
               <p>Sir, replyed <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> Love is the cauſe of his Sickneſs. The Prince by Exceſſively loving, is near the laſt moment of his Life.</p>
               <p>The King loſt between Wonder and Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on the one ſide Laughed, on the other was Sad. But the Phyſician ſwearing that all he ſaid to him was moſt true, and offering to make it appear to his own Eyes, <hi>Seleucus</hi> grew pale. And who may be probably this Lady, which hath had the power to Charm my poor Son in this maner, that he muſt dye for her Love?</p>
               <p>When the Prince was in health (replyed the Phyſician) Fortune one day brought him to ſee <hi>Polibia,</hi> who was not then my Wife; and he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her very handſom, and conſequently worthy of any Noble mans Love, was enamored ſo of her, that in brief he attempted all means to obtain her. But it being repugnant to his Nature to make uſe there of force, where Prayers were not prevalent, he was grieved ſo to the heart, that he reſolved to go dye in <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Your Majeſty knows better then I, if that journey was intended. Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards augmented in him hourly with Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, hath (extending him on a Bed) conſumed him as you ſee. Yet his ſickneſs peradventure would not have been incurable, if by the occaſion of my fatal coming to his cure, he had not both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and re-known <hi>Polibia</hi> for my Wiſe. Behold,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:180450:72"/>O ſir, how exceſſively unhappy your Condition is and Mine; how your Majeſty believing to finde a Phyſician that was able to reſtore him to his health, and I a Cure ſuitable to my Ambition, We have both of us unfortunately co-operated to his Death.</p>
               <p>If the King then Wept infinitely and Lamented, let that Father imagine, who reduced to the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one onely Son, hath placed in his Life all the hopes of his Progeny.</p>
               <p>He curſed the day of his own Nativity. He ſaid he was deceived by the Oracle, and proteſted to Heaven his Deſpair. Then heated with the boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Affections, he collected all the wittieſt Enthymems, and ſubtileſt Syllogiſms, to imprint in the heart of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> an Argument of Truth, that in him all the happineſs of <hi>Antiochus</hi> conſiſted. And that if he would as a Husband be willing to abandon <hi>Polibia</hi> to the Princes deſires, he would make his Family as fortunate as any ever was.</p>
               <p>He then dilated himſelf in ſhewing him the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the People, which depended on the Life of a Prince ſo well Qualified; the joy of a Father, who would by that means be ſeen to re-flouriſh in a Son; and the Obligation of a Favor, which a Poſterity owing him could never be forgotten.</p>
               <p>But the Phyſician feigning an Anger, which paſſed not the Confines of Diſſembling (artificially grown proud) returned him this Anſwer, That he could not tell if his Majeſty would embrace thoſe Counſels himſelf, which he labored to give him, if he was in <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> his Condition; That he was very ſure, That provided <hi>Antiochus</hi> had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:180450:73"/>of the Queen, his Majeſty would not have endured that any ſhould have perſwaded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her to the Lover.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Seleucus</hi> could not ſuffer him to go on, but crying out with a violence derived from paternal Affection, Would the Gods would be ſo pleaſed (he ſaid weeping) that my poor Son were in love with my Wife, that I without loſing any time, might run to diſpoſſeſs my ſelf of a Woman, to gain a King; but the Stars have not vouchſafed me ſo much happineſs. My deſtiny (which hath wholly ſeen my will devoted to my Sons) would not let his Life depend on my will. O, amongſt all that have ever had children in the World, moſt unfortunate Father! And how gloriouſly happy ſhould I be, if <hi>Antiochus</hi> being in love with <hi>Stratonica,</hi> it lay in my power to get my ſelf a priviledge in his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by giving him life a ſecond time? So ſpake <hi>Seleucus;</hi> and he bathed in the mean time (with his eyes diſſolved into water) the reverence of that hoary old Age, which rendered his Countenance no leſs Grave then Majeſtick.</p>
               <p>We deſire that Ability which we have not; not ſo much to uſe it, as to have ſomething more then we had. Privation is ſo loathſom a thing, that when there is even a privation of any ſuperfluity, we are troubled. Our Minde, which is always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Dominion, runs willingly to thoſe Actions that are the effects of a quality newly gained, though otherwiſe the Actions be of little Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>If this King had perceived he had been able to beatifie <hi>Antiochus,</hi> before he ſo fervently deſired
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180450:73"/>this Power in another, he would not peradventure have put into practiſe with ſo great a violence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> ſaw the King in the height of his Sorrow, he caſt himſelf down at his Feet, and beſought him to be quiet; for it was in his Power to give Life to the Prince. And proceeding in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to him <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Love to the Queen, he cauſed the pitiful Father to ſwoon through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>He employed then himſelf in obſerving his Sons alterations when <hi>Stratonica</hi> arrived, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of all the Phyſician had affirmed to him. Then without loſing of time (for the Life of the Prince was no longer in a ſtate to ſuffer delay) he aſſembled his Counſellors. There gravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the matter (after he had given them a true Information of every thing that had ſucceeded in order to the Princes diſeaſe) he ſhewed them how great the loſs was all the Kingdom would have by his death. He dilated himſelf (not without Tears) in commending his Qualities. He proved the utility which they hoped for by his Government. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the impotency of his own old Age. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the Royal Progeny that would end in his Sons <hi>individuum,</hi> if he died in that maner: And laſtly, he commended his renouncing of <hi>Stratonica</hi> to him, to preſerve him alive.</p>
               <p>The Kings opinion was unanimouſly approved of, and no leſs were all aſtoniſhed at the love of the Father to the Son, then the reſpect of the Son to the Father.</p>
               <p>This no ſooner was done, but <hi>Seleucus</hi> called
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180450:74"/>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> aſide into a Chamber. He deſired her not to wonder at what he had to tell her; for the Extravagances of the World cauſed greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazements. That he was well aſſured, That the ſickneſs of <hi>Antiochus</hi> did proceed from an infinite Love which he bare unto her: That it ſhould not appear ſtrange to her, for her Beauty could do more ſtupendious Miracles: That he ſaw no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to preſerve his Son's Life, but to renounce to him her Body, though he did not renounce unto him his Affection to her.</p>
               <p>That at leaſt he felt this Pleaſure, that her Merits had a greater Reward, then that which his waſted old Age had the Power to beſtow now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her: That a Prince of leſs Vertue then <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> was unworthy of ſo qualified a Queen: That ſhe ſhould comfort her ſelf, that if he loſt her as a Wife, he gained her as a Daughter. And finally, he beſought her, That if ſhe made Profeſſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with all his Deſires, ſhe would comply with this of accepting of <hi>Antiochus</hi> willingly; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could expreſs greater kindneſs, and nothing was more beneficial to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Gods onely know (while <hi>Selencus</hi> ſpake thus) what Conflicts in his Heart the Intereſts of his Son, and his Wife's Affections made. Heaven in that inſtant made her ſeem to him more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that in giving her away to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he might be more ſenſibly Mortified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratonica</hi> dyed with a Bluſhing, which ſeemed the effect of Strangeneſs, and was Joy's effect; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him this Anſwer, That ſhe could do no leſs
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:180450:74"/>then be amazed, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was come to that paſs; yet that ſhe was ready to perform the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>So they both went to the ſick Princes Bed; when the King had cauſed all to be gone, he began to ſpeak to the Prince in this maner:</p>
               <p>How much Sorrow, O Son, thy ſickneſs hath continually brought me, is known to that Heaven, which never yet hath ſeen (ſince thou kept'ſt thy Bed) theſe my Eyes free from Tears. I almoſt felt as much by not knowing thy Diſeaſe, as by loſing thy Life; for it ſeemed to me, that by my wanting Power to comfort my ſelf in giving thee a Remedy, Death took thee not from me, but robbed me of thee.</p>
               <p>But now ſince thy ſilence hath been underſtood, and thy deſire read in thy Melancholly, behold here <hi>Stratonica.</hi> If thy Vertue hath gained her at the rate of thy Life, my Generoſity renounces her to thee out of abundance of Affection. To hold dearer my Honor then thy Happineſs, hath been the effect of a Son, but not of an ordinary Son. To cure thee of thy ſickneſs, though it were with the loſs of my Life, muſt not be the work of a Father that is leſs then a King. <hi>Stratonica</hi> (who was born to greater Fortunes then any ſhe could hope for of me) by the Favor of Heaven is now to be happy in thee. Receive her, and cheering up thy Sadneſs with the gain of ſuch a Happineſs, endeavor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thy ſelf out of the ſnares of death. No man will ever be able to deny, that I have not (to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy health) given away the moſt Beautiful thing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:180450:75"/>in the World. But my Gift is voluntary, and my Will hath been commended by the Councel of State. All our Subjects ſee me willinger a Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then without a Son. Let this be a Circumſtance to increaſe the Beatitudes of thy Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> his weakneſs was not able to endure the ſtrokes of ſuch infinite Joys. Life fled from his Tongue, becauſe with humane words to thank his Father, was eſteemed by him too manifeſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. In the mean time he fell into a Swoon. It availed very little poor <hi>Seleucus</hi> to ſpeak rather Gravely then Affectionately to him; for by his ſpeaking, neither more nor leſs the Accident arrived which they labored to avoid.</p>
               <p>The good old King bewailed his ſudden ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Queen kept him company in weeping. And perhaps thoſe Tears ſerved likewiſe for the Obſequies of their ſeperated Nuptials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> called to the ſwooning of the Prince, intreated the King to ſend away <hi>Stratonica,</hi> for the ſick Princes Soul could not long ſuſtain it ſelf againſt her ſweet Preſence. <hi>Antiochus</hi> (returned to himſelf) fetched ſo great a Sigh, that they thought in that firſt noiſe, his much tormented Soul fled away. He then fell to weeping extreamly; nor for any thing <hi>Seleucus</hi> ſaid to him, could he anſwer him otherwiſe then by frequently kiſſing his hand. The King ſeeing that, thought it good to be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> (left alone with the Prince) cheered him up, and he diſpoſed himſelf by little and little to receive with Joy the Fortune which Fate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:180450:75"/>to him. So in few days he recovered, and preparations were made for the Marriage.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now relate here the Feaſting of the Nuptials, but my Invention (which hath loſt its Tranquility) findes it ſelf unfit to phanſie Joys. Let this Subject be a Field ſet apart for the Pen of ſome other. Mine (accuſtomed to bewail in anothers Diſaſters its own Calamities) muſt not alter its Cuſtom. If ever I ſhall change my Condition, I will change peradventure my Minde; and knowing how Laughter is formed with the Mouth, will ſhew you how it is Printed in Books. Be happy.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180450:77"/>with a better Purple. Her Eyes ſhaded with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, beheld again the light. Her Hands buſied heretofore in drying of Tears, fell again to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of making in her Hair Nets for Hearts. She made a new Inventory of her Cloaths. No Jewel, no Dreſſing, no Artifice was forgotten. She return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Noviſhip of Love, by Conſulting her Glaſs, Studying again Looks, and Inſtructing with Patience her ſelf. She diſtilled Tears with the Martyrdom of Fire by Alembicks into ſeveral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, this to ſerve for Paintings, and that for Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancies. Having reſolved to have <hi>Antiochus</hi> for her Deity, ſhe deſired to ſeem a Goddeſs to him.</p>
               <p>The Waiting-Women ſaw their own puniſhment proceed from the Joys of <hi>Stratonica.</hi> All hours are deſtined to the Services of Wantonneſs; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for diſtilling, that for tempering Ambre to ſeveral Uſes; this for curling Hair, and that for ſuch like Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>But now Impatience ſet a fire <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to whom one hour appearing a thouſand to better her Condition, ſhe grew froward with the Sun, banned the Time, and curſed the dents of the Celeſtial Wheels, which brought about ſo ſlowly the days, every moment of which imported an Age to her Wiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> recovered, but yet in Death's black and blew marks, the whiteneſs of the Privet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in his wan Countenance.</p>
               <p>Deſire ſuggeſted to <hi>Stratonica</hi> ſeveral ways of procuring amorous ſtrength with much Gold for the new married man. The Chambers were moſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180450:77"/>ſweetly perfumed, and the Baths in order to make him grow fat.</p>
               <p>The people in the mean time underſtood it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ſo prodigious a thing, that both in the publike and private Records it was without a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.</p>
               <p>To behold a King (a Father) give conſent to the paſſing away of the Treaſures of his Bed to his Son, who had dared to lay his Thoughts in his Step-mothers Boſom; O what temerity of a Son! O what indignity of a Father! The wiſeſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted it ſo far, as to take up Arms againſt him, and revenge the Kings affront on the King himſelf, not on the impudent Prince.</p>
               <p>They wondered that <hi>Seleucus</hi> (who had puniſhed the ſigns of Conſpiracy againſt the Crown in <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>) had not killed <hi>Antiochus</hi> conſpiring againſt the greateſt Intereſts of men; and that there was a Parliament (a Body of ſuch corrupt Members) that ſuffered not onely, but ſupported ſuch ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Matches. Others (ſwiming down the ſtream) commended the mad Pity, which gave by Conſent to the Kingdoms Succeſſor, the Wife of the Father the King, to preſerve (if really it was true that there was a neceſſity in it) a rebellious Princes life. Some imputed the Violence of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the Stars, for Villanies have no greater a Protector then the idle Terminations of Fate. But all ſtrivingly curſed <hi>Stratonica,</hi> the Tinder-Box and Fewel of this wicked Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> howſoever unfit for Nuptial Conflicts, in ſtead of recovering, conſumed himſelf in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:180450:78"/>ſufferings of deſire, longing extreamly to enjoy the Widow of a Husband yet living.</p>
               <p>Now in a confuſed diſtinction the orders given to Artificers were hotly purſued; and becauſe the offence might appear the more deformed, and more groſs in the Eyes of the world, they were willing to bring him on the Stage, and inrobe him with Pomp. He was to be Arrayed like a King. Theſe Nuptials celebrated againſt all Cuſtom, not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much as the ſhadow of darkneſs it ſelf, they deſired to manifeſt, and make appear as Lawful as Beautiful.</p>
               <p>O coloured Glaſſes of Paſſions, how far from the truth repreſent ye the Objects? Vices are gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the names of Vertues, and the moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Villanies enjemmed with ſpecious Titles: Yet the Thunderbolts lye neglected and idle in the Thunderers Hand, for he thinks of nothing more then of being a Deity.</p>
               <p>The Glaſs of <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Conſcience repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him the foulneſs of his corrupt and rotten marriage. He knew he had given for a diſhoneſt woman his own Wife to his own Son; He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the People derided in ſecret this his cowardly dulneſs, though they openly applauded it: and <hi>Stratonica</hi> likewiſe was much troubled, to ſee her ſelf pointed at as the Son-in-laws Miſtreſs: but the fleſh was unruly; whereupon with the danger of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his health, they haſtened the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the laſcivious Queen.</p>
               <p>She was dreſſed more extravagantly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly then ever. Her ſleeked hair hung diſplayed,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:180450:78"/>but was parted on the Forehead; on her Temples ſhe had placed two great Locks of Hair finely Curled, and very rarely Plaited, which hung down to the tip of her Ear. The Treſſes were reduced into a Roſe; the hinder part of her head was bound with a ſingle Ribband woven of many Colours. Her Neck (the delicious exceſs of Softneſs and Whiteneſs) ſeemed Alabaſter and not Fleſh, but that by its Motion in breathing it appeared to have Life. Her Throat (Beauties Pillar) laid a foundation to the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which going on farther to her Boſom, did precipitate themſelves from two little Hills into the Gulph of amorous Impatience, little Hills with cunning Artifice expoſed to the ſight of all Eyes (having the Vail drawn maliciouſly) and jetting out with laborious advantage in appearance of Severity, but yet very pliable.</p>
               <p>She was dreſſed in a Green Gown, the diſplayed Standard to her amorous Hopes. Two Bracelets of Pomandre of Ambre (covered with Gold) adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Wriſts, and her Elbows were ſhrouded in a Muff of Silk-caulwork, among whoſe Knots the Needle toyed, faſtning on each of them a Jewel.</p>
               <p>On her Neck with an obſtinate bragging of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, the choiceſt Neck-lace of Pearl (that was ever worn by Queen) proudly humbled it ſelf with a Row of the ſmalleſt Granate Stones, which with their dusky colour befriended the pretences of the Pearl againſt her Boſom.</p>
               <p>Two Serpents of Gold were her Pendants, which ſeemed with open mouth to have faſtned their Teeth on the Stalk, and at their wreathed Tails hung two ſhining Emeralds.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:180450:79"/>
               <p>On the left Lock of Hair was a little Roſe of Gold with Six Diamonds, and another ſomewhat bigger ſported up and down between her Breaſts. But every thing offended their ſight, who gazed on her Eyes, in whoſe brightneſs they ſaw Epitomized the Miracles of Light. Theſe were the Calamity, where not onely <hi>Antiochus</hi> was involved, but to which by a fatal Diſpoſition all mens Mindes were inclined.</p>
               <p>The Nuptials, were to be celebrated, to which with great ſhame <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> approached, marked with the foul Character of Adultery and Inceſt. Luxury (going hand in hand with the moſt obſcene Wantonneſs) had reſolved to conquer it ſelf, and conſulted the moſt riotous Pleaſures that ever the <hi>Roman</hi> or the <hi>Grecian,</hi> to wit, the learnedſt Luſt had invented.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Stratonica</hi> were not wanting to meet together ſecretly, by means of the Faithful and timerous Silence of the ſubtile Waiting-Women.</p>
               <p>All the Reins were abandoned to wickedneſs; but they deſired to cover the filthineſs of Inceſt with the Snow of a Contract, which was nothing elſe but a Lye before the Gods, before the People, and the Conſcience too of the Contractors.</p>
               <p>They would have endangered the Health of the newly recovered and longing Lover, if ſhe (who was very voluptuous) had not out of Love to her ſelf procured his preſervation for a longer uſe. Scarcity redoubled their Appetites, but delay was a very pleaſing puniſhment, the Blinde-lovers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180450:79"/>like <hi>Cupid,</hi> that they ſhould be immortal like him, and that ſenſual Pleaſures could not but be maintained by Life, which often miſcarries in the infancy of Fruition.</p>
               <p>Looks in the mean time and Sighs, and (in the view of the World) the lawful touch of the Hand, ſupplied what fell ſhort of the Pleaſure which in Secret they enjoyed. Two Hearts (that preſcribe to themſelves a <hi>non-plus ultra</hi> at their own little Pillars) deceive thoſe Thoughts which are never contented, unleſs they obtain ſomething more then they poſſeſs. The Soul (which thinks all the World a narrow compaſs) cannot endure to be forced by Senſe to the miſerable ſervitude of adoring a Face, in which (though it never ſo much counterfeit a Deity) yet ſees in the end that it lies, and that a fair Cheek is but a flitting ſhadow, and that the Sighs of a fond Heart melt in the end into the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juyces of Tears, and the Waters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>A thouſand Nets were pitcht to allure to theſe Nuptials, whole Provinces, or at leaſt the beſt of them. But amongſt other things, they prepared three wonderful Spectacles, which had as good ſucceſs as any thing that graced the Feaſts.</p>
               <p>The firſt was a rare Paſtoral; the ſecond a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tilting; the third a moſt ſumptuous Feaſt.</p>
               <p>There had continued in the dear and honored Memories of a free Prince of a moſt happy State, a very fine Paſtoral, whoſe Title was <hi>ARCADIA</hi> SET AT LIBERTY, the Fruit of a rare Youths Invention, who vouchſafing to imitate the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:180450:80"/>famouſeſt men, was angry with himſelf that he had not ſurpaſſed them. All the great and Noble things (which <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School boaſted of) were found in that Comedy.</p>
               <p>Though the Work was extreamly delightful, yet it did not fully anſwer the Royal Expectation, which aiming ſtill higher, had reſolved to amaze the Spectators, giving them together with <hi>Arcadia,</hi> great Enterludes of <hi>Galatea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fame already had Canonized the Poem with the applauſes of all the World, which had much ſurpaſſed the known <hi>Lyrick</hi> vein of the Latine and Greek Poets. The happy Compoſition repreſented all the Graces of Love, and expreſſed in the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Leaves whatſoever Art feigns to be Beautiful, or Nature its Model.</p>
               <p>They were buſie about the Theatre. It ſuited not with every capacity, for thoſe Heroical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are unfit for common people. A moderate Hall was therefore made choice of, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled with innumerable Workmen, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Materials under the conduct of a famous Engineer, without limiting the Expences. They diſtributed Billets to a limited number, which were a Wedding Garment to him, who was for the ſpace of four hours to be in an extaſie of Pleaſure. The Spectators were brought in with great Majeſty, but though there were multiplied Guards, yet the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Perſons was ſo ſtrong, that they could not interdict the effects of Deſire without hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many lives, whileſt a longing Expectation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Violence to the Curious, whereupon in a very
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180450:80"/>ſhort time the Theatre ſeemed repleniſhed with one ſingle Body.</p>
               <p>The Ladies crowded together, reſembled the Stars in the Milky way. Every Pillar, every Baſe, and every Chapter were taken up.</p>
               <p>The Evening-ſtar appeared, and the Night was now as bright as the Day. When the Spectators were aſſembled (all Eyes beginning to poize their own ſweetneſs) a warlike melody of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets reſounded in their Ears, whoſe ſhort noiſe was ſeconded by an harmonious Conſort of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
               <p>With a ſwiftneſs like Lightning, they drew the finely coloured Curtain, which the Eye could ſcarce follow. A fortunate extaſie then tranſported the Spectators; for a moving Heaven diſcovering it ſelf with pleaſant Draughts of a Country afar off, they ſaw an Air gliſter of the colour of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, mingling it ſelf with the fine Purple of a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, the pureſt Dyes of the fineſt Blews being mixed with them; and they ſaw afar off ſome little Brooks bubble, which expreſſed the whiteneſs of the broken Foams, the painted Waters deceiving the moſt ſubtile.</p>
               <p>With that ſlow Majeſty which in Heaven the Light moves with, accompanying the Sun its fair Fountain, they ſaw riſe from the Pavement of the wonderful Scene (as it were from the natural Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon) a regular Volumn of moſt ſhining Beams, which encompaſſed a Golden Chair made all of fiery Brightneſs. A Youth repreſenting <hi>Apollo</hi> ſate in it, having his Head adorned with a Diadem of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180450:81"/>Lights; his right hand held a golden Scepter, and his left lean'd on a Cittern ſet with pretious Stones: and while the Chair inſenſibly aſcended by an inviſible Engine, he ſang the moſt delicate and the ſmootheſt Verſes that ever humane Ear was pleaſed with, and that great Machines aſcent to the higheſt Region of the Air, and the ending of the Muſick (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to the Fable) were at the ſame time, as it was at the very ſame time that they ſaw new wonders take place of the former, while the Proſpect changing it ſelf into another Proſpect no leſs Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, they ſaw vaſt Plains ſucceed thoſe Motions of the Air, together with huge Woods, which being (near at hand) compoſed of growing Leaves, repreſented the Rural Delights with ſome Paſtoral Habitation, and then it was that (the faireſt Nymph and the gallanteſt Shepherd coming forth on the Stage) they ſaw Acted thoſe ſo ſweet, but chaſte Loves, which made the Woods famous in the true golden Age.</p>
               <p>But when in the Intervals of the Acts (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect being wholly metamorphoſed) divers Rocks conſumed by time and deſtroyed by the Waves did appear, every one believed that he was by magick Art removed to the ſhore of ſome Sea; while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Clouds open, and with reverence deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Subjection, give way to a Machine, which deſcended with ſwift Motion, carrying a flying Childe on a Globe of the ſame, taken from their Station. He covered with rich Nakedneſs (having his Eyes blinded with a golden Vail) with a Bow in his hand, and a Quiver at his ſide, boldly threw
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180450:81"/>himſelf from the Prop, and with a Pleaſant and imperious Accent Sung thus:
<q>
                     <l>Ye Clouds which want only to bear</l>
                     <l>Me here below, were proud, again</l>
                     <l>Go to the known Fields of the Air,</l>
                     <l>Tis pleaſure to theſe Wings, not pain,</l>
                     <l>At once to waft me from one Pole</l>
                     <l>To th'other. Be the Earth and Sky</l>
                     <l>So vaſt, as all Bounds to Controul,</l>
                     <l>Yet Cupid in a trice can fly</l>
                     <l>Beyond the higheſt Heaven, and</l>
                     <l>If yet there be an empty ſpace</l>
                     <l>Above that (ſuch is his Command)</l>
                     <l>He can aſcend beyond that place;</l>
                     <l>But ah what narrow limits are</l>
                     <l>One World, one Heaven, To whoſe Wings</l>
                     <l>A hundred at a time appear,</l>
                     <l>For all their length contiguous things?</l>
                     <l>What ſhall we do, my Bow? muſt we</l>
                     <l>Neglected lye, becauſe each breſt</l>
                     <l>That's Mortal, Homage does to me?</l>
                     <l>And with the flames of Love's poſſeſt.</l>
                     <l>But why name I but Mortals, All</l>
                     <l>The Powers above (enamored grown)</l>
                     <l>Shew their enflamed breſts, nor ſhall</l>
                     <l>This quiet me; All Heaven with one</l>
                     <l>Love-wound ſhall burn with Love: Give here</l>
                     <l>My Quiver, and the hotteſt Arrow,</l>
                     <l>The ſwifteſt too, which in that Sphaer</l>
                     <l>(To which compar'd the earth's but narrow)</l>

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:180450:82"/>
                     <l>Set all afire; A Nymph more fair</l>
                     <l>Then Venus, Yonder does appear</l>
                     <l>From thoſe waves like a dewy Star;</l>
                     <l>She with the Pearl contends, and is</l>
                     <l>Far whither then the milky way;</l>
                     <l>The wanton Lover ſeeketh his</l>
                     <l>Fair <hi>Galatea,</hi> who well may</l>

                     <l>And that if it have influence</l>
                     <l>At will on others, of her Eyes</l>
                     <l>(Which Beauty to the world diſpence)</l>
                     <l>It ſhall attend'its qualities,</l>
                     <l>And ſighing them invoke. Behold</l>
                     <l>The Goddeſs does appear, and I</l>
                     <l>Will now direct my ſhaft of Gold</l>
                     <l>Againſt the boſom of the sky,</l>
                     <l>And where of its Sphaers is the heart,</l>
                     <l>There print Love with my fatall Dart.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When he arrived here, he ſhot as quick as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the Air, and with a wonderful flight va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the ſight of the Spectators.</p>
               <p>And behold, the Sky was coloured with a light of Fire, and opening, delivered of a Deity, which (courted by the moſt radiant Figures in departing from the boſom of Soveraign bliſs) made harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Lamentations, while from the Waves light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved aroſe a moſt beautiful Nymph, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſoftly, and wantonly advancing among the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:180450:82"/>broken Waves. Her laſcivious Motion, and moſt lovely fair Countenance, made a Conſort of Beauty and Comlineſs ſurpaſſing all Deſcription. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the dear Daughter of <hi>Dorus</hi> enamored of the Beautiful <hi>Acis,</hi> whoſe Loves, whoſe Death, and whoſe Obſequies were ſo Nobly expreſſed in thoſe Scenes, by the help of rare Muſicians, and with Machines made by <hi>Daedalus</hi> himſelf, that when they had drawn from the rigideſt Eyes abundance of Tears, they drew too loud Applauſes from all Tongues.</p>
               <p>That renowned Spectacle being ended, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remainder of that night was ſpent in fine Balls.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding day produced a Tilting worthy of the Nuptials of a King. The night was not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, when the hours of the day had been beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſeveral Paſtimes; the leaſt part was ſpent in Sacrifices, the ſubſequent in Feaſting, where Healths were ſoundly drunk. One drank to <hi>Stratonica</hi>'s happineſs, pouring down Wines to inebrate the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and conveighing looks to the heart to enchant it: Another emptied Cups to the Health of the Prince, with whom he was otherwiſe ill ſatisfied, the trick of malignant Adulation. It was neceſſary likewiſe to ſet apart ſome time for Repoſe; the Head was encumbred with the Vapors of Wine, and the Body did languiſh under the tyranny of Pleaſures. The vain illuſions of the Nuptials (for the Dignity of the Kings) unknown to none, provoked all perſons to extravagant riotouſneſs. When they had ſlept diſorderly, every one roſe weary and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed. All corners were full of voluptuous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180450:83"/>yet they were too to be preſent at thoſe ſpectacles, which had Kings for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Protectors, for even a negligent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of little things gives offence to a Prince.</p>
               <p>A Theatre very capacious was made choice of, and the Bride now and Bridegroom were ſeated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the old Widower. The place was large, but could not contain the concourſe of people, which was great beyond all belief.</p>
               <p>At what time by the ſound of ſeveral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (beſides the huge number of Trumpets) they ſaw come through the Air on a ſhining Chariot drawn by two flying Dragons, a Woman of rare Beauty, and which, with a full hand ſtrewed Papers among the people, all printed with the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. When they had opened the Paper, they read there theſe words;</p>

My</hi> Proſerpina (<hi>raviſhed by</hi> Pluto <hi>the infernal King) bewails thoſe years that ſhe hath not ſeen her, who brought her into the World, who gave her Suck, and tenderly and affectionately nouriſhed her; ſhe went from the light of the World to the darkneſs of Styx, which (but for the light it receives from horrid Flames) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obſcure. The Bride lies in a Bed invironed with Serpents and Baſilisks, and though ſhe be ſafe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:180450:83"/>yet always ſhe's ſad. And ſhe feels more torment then pleaſure in the Arms of a Deity, that is nothing but Fury and Loathſomneſs. Behold her inſipid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſhe hath been now married many Ages, and yet ſtill is barren. A beggarly Queen of hidden Treaſures. I hear the wretches groans, which thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Ear of a Mothers Heart. Her moans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound from the damned Centre, and beſeech me to ſuccor her. I have attempted every thing in vain. I have invaded the Oracles, and they give me this anſwer, That if a fatal Lance beat not down with force the Gates of Hell (which otherwiſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible) I ſhall not ſee again my</hi> Proſerpina. <hi>I therefore have recourſe to the</hi> Elyſian <hi>Heroes, now that Heaven hath abandoned me, the World deluded me, and Hell betrayed me. And I invoke you (O Heroical Souls) and reſign to your Noble right Hands the high adventure of my Daughter buried alive among the damned.</hi>

                     <p>When thoſe Papers were read, they ſaw the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of the great Habitation, behave themſelves with majeſtick anxiety of Minde, going ſeveral ways towards the enterprize.</p>

               <p>The place was pleaſant, repreſenting <hi>Elyſium</hi> to the life; to wit, in a cool Summers ſhade without Horrors, and a Verdure without Winds. The Trees bearing perpetually leaves, ſported without fear of hoar Froſts, and of Ice. The ground produced no Flowers worſe then ſweet Ruſhes, then Anemones, and Daffodils; nor Birds (leſs eſteemed then the Nightingale) ſang in thoſe odoriferous Verdures.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:180450:84"/>Cool Brooks ran purling in ſeveral places, which making a noiſe among ſpeckled little Stones, called the Herbs to feed the little Flowers in their Waters. Innocent wilde Beaſts (all white) ran up and down in that civiliz'd little Foreſt, and the Rabbats and Hares were ſecure when they met with the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound and Leopard. The Pigeons and Turtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from many parts, now bewailing, now chanting their Loves; this enjoying her mate, and that deprived of him. The Fawn played with the Maiſtiff, and the Stag (corvetting as he rudely uſed to do) met friendly with the Dogs, which in ſtead of biting him, licked his Haunch, and wantonly played with him. In fine, there was nothing there but Love.</p>
               <p>The Spectators were delighted with wonders of that kinde drawn to the appearance of the truth, while with that celerity that one dream is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into another, they ſaw from one head of the great Theatre in vaſt ſhews a delicious Sea-Coaſt, on the Chryſtals of whoſe calm Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a Veſſel of rare Form came dancing, as it were, whoſe Sails were Cloaths of unknown Colours, but graceful; inſomuch that they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered contemptible the fineſt Blews, and the Purples.</p>
               <p>All the Fabrick was reſplendent with Gold, finely extended on the Figures and Pillars which adorned it: When it arrived at the ſhore, it reſted ſecurely on its Anchors; and when they had let down certain Ladders, they ſaw ſome <hi>Ethiopians</hi> richly arayed, diſ-embark certain Steeds very pompouſly trapped,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:180450:84"/>with the like number of Squires. One Cavalier alone of a very gallant preſence went aſhore, with a ſhining Helmet, gilt Arms, and an upper Garment empailed with Knots of Pearls. He began at the ſound of many Trumpets to walk very ſoftly in the Field, and in the mean time Six Damſels diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the great Theatre the like Writ of Defiance.</p>

He was drawn by Six Courſers which were ſadled, and on every one of them rode a Squire of rare Beauty, in a white Garment like Milk. One of the reſt that was the fineſt, led a Steed in a Silken ſlip, who though he was naturally generous and fierce, yet came prancing by cuſtom very quietly, and obeying as it were with judicious Diſtance the tender hands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that did lead him: when they had turned about ſoftly, the Chariot ſtood ſtill with the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, while the Papers were diſtributed, which ſaid in this maner:</p>

               <p>So great a Captain, who was very rich in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, came no whit puffed up. Haughtineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes not Majeſty, but diminiſhes it. He ſeemed not to remember, That when he was yong, in the firſt Conflict againſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at <hi>Pavia,</hi> he had preſerved the life of his Father; That in the mortal Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> he had upheld the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo as he left not empty <hi>Romes</hi> Neſts, who being at five Luſtres made <hi>Praetor,</hi> had won the vaſt <hi>Spains,</hi> had defeated the two famous <hi>Aſdrubals,</hi> and ſet his triumphing Foot on the Gullet of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> He ſeemed not to remember the great Sirname procured to himſelf for the Third of the conquered World, nor the Title of <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> acquired by his Valor to his Brother; Neither ſeemed he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the incomparable enterprize of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, while he fortified himſelf againſt the rare Beauties he had gotten in the Wars.</p>
               <p>So great a Heroes (from whom was to deſcend one of the worlds greateſt Pedigrees, to make the State of <hi>Venice</hi> more and more renowned in the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Progeny) ſeated himſelf with the reſt in a convenient place, while with ſundry Devices the remainder of the Champions went forwards. One ſeemed the pious <hi>Trojane,</hi> whoſe ſhoulders ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Majeſty of the exil'd Houſhold-Gods,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:180450:86"/>and the decrepid age of his impotent Father.

               <p>
                  <hi>Jaſon</hi> began with his ſtrong Mace to ſhake the <hi>Stygian</hi> Gates, and they heard rude lamentations anſwer the ſtrokes in a melodious maner, as of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple affrighted. And they ſaw iſſue forth from the tops of certain Towers, Globes of thick Smoak and horrid Fire. Various Monſters paſſed along the Walls with terrible Snowts, and Weapons unknown to this world. Theſe ſometimes threatning, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flying, repreſented ſeveral Figures in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall Dance expreſſing Fury and Fear.</p>
               <p>At the third Shock of <hi>Jaſons</hi> Lance the Gates opened a little, and great Volumns of fire iſſued out at them; but they quickly cloſed again, ſcarce ſuffering the Miſeries of Hell to appear. All the reſt made ſucceſſively tryal of their Force, but that high adventure was reſerved for the generous <hi>Scipio,</hi> who at the firſt ſtroak hit the <hi>Stygian</hi> Gates ſo powerfully, that falling with a horrible noyſe on the ground with a terrible Earthquake, they diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſudden the unhappineſs of the Kingdom of Sorrow. They ſaw there the Nieces of <hi>Belus,</hi> with eternal torment of fruitleſs labor carry Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters perpetually running out, and perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing. <hi>Syſiphus</hi> there likewiſe to rowl up and down the great Stone with continual Viciſſitudes of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:180450:87"/>aſcending and deſcending. Beſides, they ſaw there the unfortunate <hi>Prometheus</hi> tyed to a ſtone, and feeding a torturing Vultur with the living meat of his bowels ſtill reviving. A little way off, the greedy <hi>Tantalus,</hi> Thirſty, with his lip touching the cool water, and Hungry, with his hand on the bait of the Odoriferous and Vermilian Apple. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted there infinite other ſpectacles of ſad Miſeries. <hi>Pluto,</hi> overthrown by the Power of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Victory, ſurrendered now <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> who at laſt came running to meet the open arms of <hi>Ceres,</hi> to kiſs reciprocally one another. She went from a Scorched, to a Flouriſhing Ground, from Fires to Coolneſs, from Weeping to Joys; in fine, from Hell to the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields. They ſaw Joy triumph in their ſmiling Brows, and all the Theater ſeemed to rejoyce at the pleaſure which at laſt the glad Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enjoyed. All the inſtruments (which many ages paſt had been uſed in Muſick) were here heard to fill the Air, while the <hi>Stygian</hi> Smoaks (not bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and of brimſtone, but of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Ambre</hi>) delighted their Noſtrils.</p>
               <p>The Enterprize being ended, and <hi>Proſerpina</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> ſeated in a very fine Chariot with triumphing <hi>Scipio,</hi> they ſaw Fame deſcend on two great Wings with a loud Trumpet, who approaching at laſt to the Spectators, with a few, but neat and pithy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, did diſmiſs the people.</p>
               <p>The Banquet remained, the laſt Prodigy of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Magnificence. All diligence was uſed to finde out skilful men to pleaſe the Palate. Cooks and Sewers were ſent for from far. Even theſe in their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180450:87"/>kinde boaſted much, and as the emulation was Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, ſo the ſtrife was Audacious. One would have them Banquet after the maner of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> another as the <hi>Syrians</hi> uſe to do, and this after the faſhion of <hi>Aſia.</hi> They bought up in all Countreys all the Fleſh, Fiſh and Spices, by meaſure, without meaſure, not forbearing for the price. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer can maintain profuſe Expences: The Ships (when the Wind was not favorable) made the Seas ſubmit to them by the force of the Oars, and (in deſpight of adverſe <hi>Aeolus</hi>) brought the flitting Pleaſures of a Bit and a Draught.</p>
               <p>For this preparation (made to the ſhame of a Father, of a Wife, of a Son, of a Bride, of a Widower, and of a Lover, the Riddle of <hi>Sphynx,</hi> and a Knot to be diſſolved by the Sword) it ſeemed they were not ſatisfied with any poſſible Tribute: What ſhould have maintained a Court many Moneths, they prepared for one day. It is not hard to perſwade men to exceſs.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Court he gave order for placing four great Marble Ciſterns (a coſt rather vicious then ſplendid) which for ſome hundred years had ſerved for a receptacle of Waters in the Gardens of the Kings his Predeceſſors, and aſſigning to every one of them as much Wine (of the four beſt ſorts, not onely of the growth of the Countrey, but which came from foreign Provinces) as for the ſpace of two days running out of very large Mouths, with free acceſs to thoſe of the Country, and to Strangers, might content the moſt inordinate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:180450:88"/>
               <p>In the ſecond Court were diſpenced to ſatiety (to innumerable heads of the people) Bread, variety of Fleſh, and rare Fiſh.</p>
               <p>In the third coſtly Tables ſtood provided for Three thouſand perſons, which were nobly ſerved, where none but the Soldiers had leave to ſit down. Two hours were allowed to every company of the Gueſts, and all the day and all the night were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that maner; and to every one was given at his departure, a Golden Meddal with the Pictures of <hi>Stratonica</hi> and <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt Court were aſſembled all the Officers of War, every one of which had preſented him a Horſe, and the chiefeſt had likewiſe a Chain, and an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Page.</p>
               <p>Neither was the great Hand of Royal Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence leſs open to the Ladies. Jewels of a great value, Squires of a rare wit, proud Horſe-litters, Cloaths of Gold; brave preſents in fine, fit for great ones to receive, and for Kings to beſtow.</p>
               <p>Every working hand was imployed in ſetting out the Banquet, the ſupream Prodigy of Luxury. Even the vacant Veſtals ſpent their preciouſeſt time in the provocations of Wantonneſs and Gluttony.</p>
               <p>A moſt ſplendent Hall opened in a Quadrangle, ſupported by twelve rows of Pillars: There the Tables were prepared; one by it ſelf, for <hi>Seleucus</hi> and the new married couple; one a little lower, for twelve Princeſſes and the like number of Princes, placed one againſt the other. Others without much diſtinction, for above Three hundred Knights. The beſt Muſicians met there, who ſinging unchaſte
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:180450:88"/>Songs (by calling <hi>Venus</hi> to <hi>Bacchus</hi>) even in the Boſom of the coldeſt decrepid Age, could ſtir up wanton Thoughts.</p>
               <p>While they Dine, and that infinite Cups are now emptied, with great abuſe always of the Gifts of Nature, and the Labors of Art, behold an Eagle comes in at the Window, which (three or four times flying round) deſcends, and with his Talons and Beak, ſeizes on the Crown from the Head of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> nor could the Waiters (though they did all they could) forbid his departure toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the prey. He flew where it was impoſſible to refinde him. Now this unworthy King deſerved not that Heaven ſhould vouchſafe him the Honor to preſage his deſtruction by Prodigies; but the Character of Kings (the greateſt thing Heaven gives to Mortals) did grant this Mortal priviledge to him.</p>
               <p>The Expedition arrived on the Wings of an Eagle, and denoted Celerity in the execution. It was not the Screech-Owl of <hi>Pallas,</hi> a Warrier, a Goddeſs, but at laſt a courteous Virgin: Not the Peacock of <hi>Juno,</hi> a Bird very ſtately, and which ends her threats, or rather her anger in cryes; much leſs the Pigeon of <hi>Venus,</hi> the Meſſenger always of Love. It was the Provoſt-Marſhal of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, who is not ſoon angry, and threatens not but to ſtrike. The Gods had determined in a full Conſultation, that the Thunder-bolt ſhould not fall in vain.</p>
               <p>Many were the Diſcourſes concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The wiſeſt men grew pale at it, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:180450:89"/>King (behaving himſelf ridiculouſly) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted ſo conſiderable an Accident, as a thing of Chance. It is Fatal in ſuch caſes (which threaten near at hand) when Princes become ſtupid, and ſee not themſelves what all men behold. Hiſtories give Preſidents of it to a number without number. <hi>Antiochus</hi> (more a Stateſ-man then a Son) though he outwardly ſeemed afflicted, was inwardly well pleaſed; and ſince he had taken the Wife from his Father, he thought to rob him likewiſe of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Water having broken down the Banks, was not ſatisfied in violently running with part of its force, but will carry with it all its whole power; and though the Corn be ſpoiled in the Field, the Vine-roots extirpated, and the Edifices overthrown, it cares not for any thing but the Effects of its Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>The wanton <hi>Stratonica</hi> trembled likewiſe, and brake (that ſhe might not be obſerved) a Groan, which iſſued out of her Breaſt; but ſhe could not ſuppreſs a hot file of Sighs, which came from her Breaſt: Not for <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whom ſhe hated at laſt as the Author of their common ſhame; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Father ſhe beheld the Son threatned, and in the ruine of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> foreſaw her own fall.</p>
               <p>Onely the Mother of <hi>Climenes</hi> was exceedingly glad of the Prediction: She intervened the joys of others, being purſued by her Sorrows. Her Body was apparrell'd with gay Cloaths, her Minde with mourning. She went muſing how to further the Diſaſters of that Court towards its utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180450:89"/>and though her Deſign had no effect, yet her Will was not wanting.</p>
               <p>Now the Dinner inclined towards an end, and ſeveral Birds let looſe out of Cages with Golden Bars, made the Hall reſound for joy in a glad noiſe, compelling all to catch them; for they were not Birds of that Country, but taken with Golden Nets caſt in remote Mountains, and in Woods afar off. The Ginney-Bird, the Parrot, the Pheaſant, and ſeveral leſs Fowl eſteemed for their Beauty or Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At which time a Herald (cloathed in a Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour Suit) enters in the heat of the Revelling, with three Arrows in his Hand, and a dead Mans Skull in-wrought in his Coat, with artificial Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and demands Audience. Then ſhe (who took ill the Death of her Son) cheered up her ſelf, and in thoſe deadly Prodigies read her unlucky Joys. A horrid Silence accompanied the paces of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Meſſenger, from his enterance into the Hall, till he came to the Royal Tables. The Soul (which participates of Divinity) chiefly preſages miſchievous Accidents. They could conceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Diſaſter. The Herald without bowing himſelf at all, or ſhewing any ſign of reſpect, in a clear ſound, and intelligible to all, ſaid as followeth, That there was a Cavalier below in the Court, whom Victory onely, or Death could diſcover; That (inflamed with the Deſire of a juſt Revenge) he was come to defie <hi>Antiochus</hi> body to body, to prove to him by Arms, that there lived not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthier Prince then himſelf. <hi>Antiochus</hi> (though ſurprized in a time when his Minde was beſotted
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180450:90"/>with his Loves, and his Body abandoned to his Luſts) yet naturally being turbulent and fiery, throwing far from him the Chair in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, roſe up, having onely a Sword by his ſide; but <hi>Stratonica</hi> neglecting the gravity of a Queen, and retaining the Fury of a Lover, without having regard to the incumbrance of her Royal Robes, threw her ſelf from the Throne, and crying out like a Mad-woman, and breaking forth into Sobs and Groans, clung about his Neck as pale as Death, and ſwooned indeed, and was dead, by what her Face expreſſed. But being recovered with Vinegar, and recalled to Life by cool Waters, <hi>Antiochus</hi> beſought her not to forbode him ſo ill, and in the mean time he Armed himſelf to fight with the unknown Cavalier. He deſcended envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with many Princes, whom (entreating) he commanded not to ſtir, except it were to convey him out of the Field either Dead or a Conqueror. His panting Heart did haſten half as faſt again the courſe of his life, now at laſt very flitting, and ſang to it ſelf in Deaths tone, the now unappealable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous Divinations. But the vain Prince ſeemed unconcerned and undaunted, though poſſeſſed with fear. <hi>Mars</hi> (it is true) is the Lover of <hi>Venus,</hi> but he lets himſelf be caught in the Net of a Smith. Seldom a curled Hair, and a Countenance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with Sivet and Ambre, is the dwelling of a couragious Soul.</p>
               <p>The Court being gone with mute Fury from the Combatants, <hi>Antiochus</hi> coped with his unknown enemy. He skilfully fencing did put by his thruſts,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:180450:90"/>covering his flank with his Sword, which had not any other defence. <hi>Antiochus</hi> offending him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe defended himſelf, endeavoring to maſter Art by Art. Sometimes he contracted his ſtride, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times elonged it; directing one while the mortal Point to the Eyes, and one while to the Breaſt of his Adverſary. The other as cunning as he and as ſtrong, did affright him with ſudden Paſſado's, and the male of his Corſlet being broken in the end, the Prince ſaw himſelf wounded in the Thigh. The blood began to ſpin out of it, inſomuch that as a Bull becomes fell, when he ſees himſelf bleed, he raging fell on him, and wounding him deeply in the Arm, was revenged of his Adverſary. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> now hurt in many parts, loſt blood in ſeveral places, and his life ſought an <hi>exit</hi> at many holes, while not reſolving where, the concealed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion with the fatal Point thruſt it out, diſplaying him ſooner dead them in an agony.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Seleucus</hi> beheld his Son fall, in whom he ſuppoſed to live after death, and for whoſe ſake he had parted with his Honor, he was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed through vexation mixt with anger, that he ſeemed to lodge all Hell in his Countenance. He blaſpheming demanded his Arms, ſo as (being maſtered by Fury) he was hardly underſtood. He precipitouſly armed himſelf, for the Stars oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him with violence, ſeek the way to their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. In the mean time the unknown Cavalier walked warily, but proudly in the field of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and beheld his Laurels watered abundantly with the blood of dead <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:180450:91"/>
               <p>Whoſoever hath beheld the Maiſtiff-dog, who (having his neck armed with ſharp irons) with his foaming Chops, and enflamed Eyes falls on the Bull, who comes bellowing and carrying his Horns low, and bravely ſeizes on his Ear, beholds <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who abandoning himſelf went towards his Sons murtherer, who receiving him like one that is willing to preſerve himſelf and ſuppreſs his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſtroak at him impetuouſly; but the mortal edge glanced aſide moſt opportunely, and cauſed the blow to fail to the ground; by reaſon of which <hi>Seleucus</hi> felt great pain in his arm, ſo as very hardly he was afterwards able to uſe it. The other return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtroak with more cunning, and began to claſp <hi>Seleucus</hi> in that maner, that at laſt he ſhewed fear in all he did. He could not ſtir, but he trod in the blood of his dear Son, and ſtumbled at the bloody corps, in whoſe wounds for his ſake he ſaw the Kingdom loſt, and the World dead to him. The unfortunate King bewailed himſelf extinct by his onely Sons death, and lamented the Royal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity decayed in that onely ſprowt; whereupon redoubling his weak force, and provoking to more fierceneſs his adverſary, he flew on him (throwing away his ſword) with his unarmed arm, and claſping him about the hips, with a ſharp Hanger which he drew from his ſide, he wounded him often between the joynts of his Breſt-plate; but ſo to overcome him, was the way to kill himſelf; for the unknown Cavalier (when he felt himſelf thruſt through the Reins) drew out a ſhort Dagger, and hid it beneath in the belly of <hi>Seleucus:</hi> Whereupon with reciprocal
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:180450:91"/>death they fell down in their mixt blood, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired at the ſame time. While the people ſaw Death (armed with other Weapons then his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sithe) mow down the Kings, they felt a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chilneſs run up and down in their Bones.</p>
               <p>Then the Helmet was pulled off from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſtrangers head, and preſently he was known by <hi>Stratonica</hi> for <hi>Demetrius</hi> her Father. Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſorrow poſſeſſed then all the corners of her Soul. She ſaw the Concluſion, but underſtood not the Myſtery. Whereupon ſhe ſeemed a <hi>Niobe,</hi> That in her Lover and her Father had loſt fourteen Children at once. Her Cheeks loſt their red, and reſigned up their whiteneſs, a ſad Lead-colour ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding their Beauty; and where her Affliction could not repreſent her rather dead then tormented, her Hand ſupplied with blows that defect; ſo (killed many ways) ſhe threw herſelf on the Corps, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of her Father, and ſometimes of <hi>Antiochus</hi> (being all bloody and weeping) giving them kiſſes mixt with Love and with Pity, and howling (like a woman tranſported in the ſervice of <hi>Bacchus</hi>) till laying her hand by chance on the bloody Dagger which wounded her Father (ere her Governeſs could hinder her) ſhe thruſt it into her Boſom, but lightly (for an incontinent hand is always coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and bending downwards, fell on the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of her Father, her Husband, and her wanton Lover. She was taken up while ſhe ſeemed to expire (more wounded with Anguiſh then the Iron) and on the arms of ſeveral Maids (which ſerved her in the nature of a pitiful Beer) carried into the Pallace.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:180450:92"/>
               <p>All the Court did nothing elſe but weep bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, onely among ſo many diſcontented, the old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Climenes</hi> ſeemed comforted.</p>
               <p>While every thing was diſordered, and the Kingdom tottered without Pillars to ſupport it, they ſaw deſcend through the Air from on high, a Globe of a thick Cloud, from which they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ever and anon with great craſhing, flying Fires. This ſtaying over the middle of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Court, opened with a terrible Earth-quake, and an incredible horror of the Spectators.</p>
               <p>The Night came on, and the darkneſs now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, did cover the unfortunate Pallace, when it was driven away again by many Lights, which (iſſuing out of the boſom of the great-bellied cloud) diſtributed themſelves with limited mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures into diſtinct ſpaces, without ſhewing in what maner they exiſted. A woman of a declining age (with her hair hanging looſe, of a ſevere and grave Countenance, clad in a Brown Robe, with a Wand in her right hand, and a Book in her left) command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Silence, and ſtilled their weeping and cryes, in a ſhrill tone afterwards began in this maner:</p>
               <p>People, Lament not the deaths of unworthy Kings, bewail your ſelves, and accuſe the Stars for ſo baſely ſubjecting you to the Rule of ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Bewail ye rather the encreaſing Diſaſters which reſerve you to greater Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus, Demetrius, Antiochus, Stratonica</hi> (though Kings) were all born of baſe Seed in a Cradle of Gold, whoſe Mothers many ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted foul Adulteries. Of abject Embraces (ſought
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:180450:92"/>after in the Stable and the Field) they conceived their Iſſue the dregs of the People. Behold the Son that preſumed to diſhonor his Father; behold the Father, who endured, rather favored his own ſhame; behold the engenderer of the Adultereſs, whom youthfulneſs (wanton of it ſelf) had made by his connivance more Audacious.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom a whole Age ſhall be the ſport of Fate, and ſcorn of the World. Every Luſtre ſhall have a new King, they ſhall dye all by Poyſon or the Sword; for diſhoneſt Beginnings have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Ends.</p>
               <p>She ſaid ſo, and vaniſhed, and the Lights vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her; whereupon by the light of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Torches, every one retired to his home.</p>
               <p>When the Sun was riſen, many troubles aroſe in that Court, many pretending to the Crown, this by open Force, and that by clear Right. Among other, <hi>Alicander Seleucus</hi> his kinſman (a haughty man and indiſcreet, being oppoſed very ſtifly by ſome, but followed by moſt) having impriſoned or killed his Competitors, uſurped the Throne, inveſting his ſhoulders to Tyranny with the ſpecious Robe of a King.</p>
               <p>The firſt Prey he aſpired to was <hi>Stratonica,</hi> who (eaſily rehealed by the Surgeons) in all thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts and Lamentations, was forced to take again the poſſeſſion of her uſual Beauty. <hi>Alicander</hi> was the uglieſt of all men, as ſhe of all women the moſt Beautiful. The ſmall Pox had ſo eaten his Face, that he ſeemed a Monſter. He was quite Bald, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few ſingle Locks about his temples. His
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180450:93"/>Noſe ſtood awry, and was flat, his Eyes grim, his Lips ſwoln, and his Face full of ulcerous Pimples. Some Tufts of hair hung down from his Chin incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Aſh-colour, and very ill ordered. Such a one <hi>Stratonica</hi> enjoyed, who was exceeding luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comely, as another <hi>Venus</hi> in the ſix and twentieth year of her age, while (loathing him in her minde, and ſweetning her diſaſters with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Antiochus</hi>) ſhe embittered with contempt his inſipid Delights. Whereupon, being diſtaſted if not glutted, he reſigned her up as a prey to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Soldiers, to the end they might have their fill of her. So, broken in a ſhort ſpace of time, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by unhappy Diſeaſes, <hi>STRATONICA,</hi> a little before the Treaſure of the Age and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the People, without having ſo much as a courſe Cloth to cover her, returned rotten, not onely naked, to the Womb of the Earth.</p>
